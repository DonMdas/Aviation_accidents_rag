lowing observations were made:

The frame structure for mounting the electronic boards
and the transport/snvironmental enclosure was bent on
front side due to impact. The transport/environmental
enclosure had detached from the mountings but appeared
to be intact except for smoke deposit on casing. The
top frame cover was removed by opening cut the attach-
ment phillips screws to take out the enclosure. There
was no apparent damage to stepper motor, connector = and

‘the wiring appeared to be intact. The motor cover had

detached during the impact and there was some stiction

_ in the motor rotation, although the belt appeared to be

intact. The condition inside the enclosure was good

and tape appeared to be intact.

The enclosure of UFDR of the crashed aircraft was then
installed in” a serviceable UFDR of M/s.Sahara ‘India

~ : Station Palam for water supply from their water

tenders, - The continuity of water supply was

- maintained through the static water tanks at

- a the airport.

- , i@. The total time taken to control the fire was

about 43 minutes (1457 hrs IST to 154@ hrs IST)

as per IAAI log books. However, as per Delhi
Fire Services, the fire was under control at

a oe 1615 firs.

di. Though fuselage of the Aeroflot was completely
- charred, “the spread of fire on to the wings was

checked which contained about 5@ tonnes of fuel.

Ss ; 12. Number of vehicles and ground equipment were
aN
destroyed in this fire. Also, apron area and
three aerobridges suffered damage. There were

nine casualities and 4 persons suffered injuries.

a
i
.

On the date of accident, the Airport Authority Fire
Services had 35,886 ltrs of water, 400 Kgs of DCF
and 5@@ Kgs.of BCF. Total of 42 Fire Fighting

Personnel were on duty.


14. There was no mobile water replenishment arrange-

ment for the CFTs positioned for the fire tighting

resulting in dislocation of CFTs from ideal posi—

tion to collect water from Static Tank No.9? & 11.

“Thus the fire fighting operation was carried out

in stages.

i5. The quality of the produced foam through the CFTs
of IAAI was not standard and the fire extinguish
ing media was not creating required actions at
the fire to combat, as stated by their fire

officer.

16. On two frash Fire Tenders of IAAI, the monitor

controls was unserviceable and on other two Crash
Fire Tenders, these monitors became unserviceable

“during fire fighting operation. Side channels for
fire fighting were used on these crash fire

tenders. The jet throw through the monitor did

not cover the specified distance and CFTs were r
repositioned to the close vicinity of fire in

the danger zone.

‘TEST AND_ RESEARCH

1» ELIGHT CONTROLS
a) GENERAL
The Boeing 737 aircraft features a powered flight

control system which has ailerom and flight spoilers

for lateral control(roll), elevators and movable hori-

th

—~ zontal stabiliser for longitudinal contral(pitch),

rudder and yaw damper for directional controltyaw),

and high lift devices to provide lift at the lower

a, speeds for take-off and landing.

Frimary flight controls(ailerons, elevators, rudder)
; are powered by hydraulic systems “A’ and.‘B’. Either
oe ; of hydraulic system, alone, can power any primary

speed brakes for flight and ground aeradynamic braking


j

control- surface. In the event that both hydraulic
systems ‘A’ and ‘B' become unavailable, the aileron and
elevator controls revert to a mechanical manual
reversion backup system and the rudder is powered by
the standby hydraulic system.

b) EXAMINATION

A group was constituted by DGCA to examine into flight
. -

coantrois. Following are the salient observations from

the report.

i) TRAILING EDGE FLAPS

The system consists of four flaps, two on each wing
which are Operated hydraulically through mechanical
transmission. Each flap has two flap screw jacks.

Thus there are a total of eight flap screw jacks.

Three flap screw jacks(No.6,7 and @) on the starboard
wing were found intact. No.5 fiap screw jack, which
was not intact, was identifiec from the part number.
Three screw jacks(No.1,3 and 4) were identified from
their orientation and attachment. No.2 flap. screw jack
could not be located. The measurement of various
recovered screw jacks of accident aircraft, as record-—

ed, are given below;—

The flap screw jack measurements on the accident
aircraft are quite close to the Fiap 15 configuration
when compared with the dimensions provided in Boeing

737 Control Position Data Document No. D&-1i95i2-1 Rev.

'D’.

(ii. LEADING EDGE FLAPS -

There are four L.E.flaps, two each on starboard = and
port wings. All the four L.E.flap actuators have been
identified. Actuator No. i & 2 are intact while No.2 $

4 are in broken condition. During leading edge flap

extension, the actuator extension is about 7.95 inches.

In the accident aircraft case, the extension of No.1 &

% actuators was also found to be about 7.797 inches.

-Thus the leading edge flaps were fully extended at the

time of accident.

74


iii. LEADING EDGE SLATS
i There are six leading edge slats three on each side
which are actuated hydraulically by six actuators. Out

I . wee

j ef six actuators, only five could be retrieved. Actua—

tor No.4 & 5S are intact while another three are in
i broken cendition and could net be identified as for
j their position due to breaking away of the name plates.

From the physical observations of the retrieved

actuators, it may be concluded that the same were fully

extended.

iv. SPOILERS ++ -
There are eight spoilers, four on each wing. No.1,4,5 &
i 8 “are ground spoilers while No.2,3, 6&7 are flight
3 ; oo * spoilers. Ground spoilers No. 4 & 5 have two actuators
each while other spoilers has only one actuator.

Spoilers Nowts) 6,7.&% 8 are attached to starboard wing

and found flush with the surface. They are badly

burnt. Fiston extension measurements of the rest of
the spoiler actuators also indicated that the spoilers

were retracted at the time of crash.

v. AILERONS _:
a . There is one aileron on each wing operated by two power

-_ control units (System ‘A’ and System ‘B’). Both the

~ os . - aileron PCU‘'s were recovered and were found to be


detached and in damaged condition due to impact

_ and
g ~~ fire. The aileron trim gearbox was found in jammed

condition in near neutral position. One of the aileron
a PCU’s(lower) actuator extension is 1.125 inch corre-
Lea . ___=ponding to port aileron deflection about 9 degrees
é down. Another PCU(upper) actuater extension is @.25
B inch corresponding to starboard aileron deflection of
3

about 16 degrees up. Hoth the left and right aileron
G drive quadrants were found badly damaged. Drive cables

oe _. were found separated and curled up. The left aileron

a wks . quadrant was found jammed in counter clockwise direc—
a a tion with the push rod to aileron broken. No positive

conclusion could be drawn from the above observations.

vi. HORIZONTAL STABILIZER

The horizontal stablizer can be moved by motor operated
screw jack. The screw jack was found intact and its
bail-nut was found jammed in position. The measured
position of the ball nut corresponds to about 7 units
3 up (within green band of take-off configuration) _ as

confirmed on the serviceable aircraft.
vii. ELEVATOR

Both the elevator FCU’S were found intact and in fully
retracted position. The feel and centring springs and

feel actuators moved smoothly and normally. The fully

7O


A a
retracted position of both the FCU'’s indicate elevator
‘up’ position. However, in view of impact forces

cannot be said that this was the elevator position

Prior to impact.

viii. RUDDER

Rudder was found intact and attached to the vertical

7 fin. Both, main and standby rudder PCU’s were found
7 we intact. When the main FCU is in operation the standby
. idles. The actuator extension of main FCU was 3.25
_ inches while that of standby actuator was 2.8 inches.
_ As checked from the Document No.Dé-i95i2-1 Rev ’D’ of
_ Boeing Ce. regarding ‘737 aircraft control position
_ data’, .the above measured actuator lengths indicate
_ that the rudder was deflected towards right about three
_ , and. @ quarter degrees. ‘However, in view of impact
_ damage to the aircraft and its controls, the exact
~ position of the rudder prisor toe crash could met be

a positively concluded.

Tests on auxiliary rudder FCU were also satisfactory

77


except servo valve neutral position test which was
“found to be marginally out of limits. With this varia-

tion the units will still remain functional.
EXAMINATION OF UNDERCARRIAGE

Nese landing gear attachment was found det.ched from
main structure. Upper and lower drag brace links were
found damaged and came out from the main structural
fitting. Both the nose steering actuators were found
in damaged condition. In the port main gear assembly,
one of the tyres was found missing and the correspond—-
ing brake assembly found stripped open. While other
was found damaged due to fire. Walking beam was found
attached with the landing gear, however, it came out
from the main structure. Oleo strut and locking mecha—
nism were damaged. Side strut found collapsed. Star—
board landing gear system disintegrated. ODleo piston
broke into two parts. One of the tyre was found burst.
Side strut was partially collapsed and the drag brace
was intact. Walking beam was found een both
from main structure and landing gear. Both the main
and nose landing gears had sxtensive fire damage. Both
the main and nose landing gear actuators were found in
fully extended position indicating that all the three
gears. were in fully retracted condition at the time of

accident.

During the reply of the CVR tape, it was observed that
a horn of unsafe landing configuration had sounded at

reference time 74.44 and aititude alert hern at refer-

ence time 17:42. To confirm that these horns were

truly ‘the unsafe landing configuration horn and alti-
tude alert horn respectively, comparative spectrum
analysis of the horn seunds, as recorded in the CVR and
Laboratory recerded true horn sound, was carried out at
i , DGCA Laboratory and then at the facilities of National

Aerospace Laboratory, Hangalore and Bhabha Atomic

Pe “STALL. WARNING SYSTEM ~-
Warning of an impending stall is required to otcur a
minimum .of seven percent above actual stall speed.

Natural stall warning (buffet) usually occurs at a

ISSUES FNVOLVED

Before dealing with the vital issues/aspects
to be examined in the enquiry, the issues/aspects in
respect of which there can neither be any controversy
nor there is one, namely sabotage and weather

conditions may first be dealt with.

SABOTAGE

During investigation the wreckage was

7

ccexamined --by a group. constituted for the purpose (of

finding out the explosion/sabotage being the cause . of
the accident. The disintegrated parts of the aircraft
were examined with a view to find out whether the crash

was: due to any explosive device or not, The sailent

_ pbservations of the group report ares~

1. The fragments/debris materials may have

curling/ringlet effects and spike toothed fractures on

metal surface. These characteristics have net been

observed in any part ‘ot the wreckage.

2. The incident of an explosion, the fragment
will strike the surface at a glancing angle and produce
gouge marks in the surface. No such gouge marks were

noticed on the recovered main wreckage.

91


3 Due .to the hot detonation gases, melting

and

@rosion on the surface of the metal is Possible which

is termed as ‘gaswash’. The debris/wreckage found in

heavily melted condition is not due to detonation

gases, but may be due to excessive heat generated

during the fire,

4, Cupping and dishing in the near vicinity
metal surface isa very common phenomenon with high

explosive detonation, which is not observed

on
examination of the wreckage.
5. There is possibility of embedding the high
velocity fragments in rubber foams/cushions during an
explosion. The recovered cushion seats were examined

to find out penetration holes of fragments/embedded

fragments, No such sign of Penetration have been

neticed. : -

&. No part of bomb such as battery, wire,

Portion of detonators etc were recovered,

7. On detailed inspection and investigation of
the wreckage debris: of the = crached aircraft, na
charatteristic evidence of an explosion such as
fragmentation, curling/ringlet effects, spike toothed

structure Of metals, gas washing, pitting and rolled

edges have been noticed, No sian of cupping/‘dishing of

92 -


7 =

- metal surface is seen. No positive characteristics of

= a mid air explosion were observed from the

~ wreckage/debris examined.
In view of above, itis conciudéd that crash
in question did not occur-- due to sabotage or explo-

sion.

* WEATHER CONDITIONS.

ai!

«
~ : The metrological information/reports supplied
- by the Met Office of Delhi (Palam) indicate that there
_. was no significant weather at Palam around the time of
~ the accident. The aircraft was on visual circuit and
~ landing.;. The following weather ehisted at Palam around
~ the time of the accident:-

It is evident from the above that during the
period of training flight the visibility was around @ kms

and the weather was very fine and it did. net contribute

“directly ‘or -indirectly to* the accident. The weather

condition in Delhi was, therefore, not the cause of the
accident.

this report as also the facts about external damage suffered
by the outer casing of this unit and also facts about the
data retrieved at M/s.VSM Aerospace Facility at Bangalore
and at National Aerospace Laboratory, Bangalore. On perusal
of the data decoded at the said two laboratories it was

Considered necessary to get the data further refined at’ the

laboratory of National Transport Service Hoard, Washington

who had long experience in the field. The Unit was
accordingly taken to Washington, USA and Mr.Dannis R.Grosy
and WMr.Elfard W.Dickenson participated in the meetings fer
analysis of the data and for read out from the tape of the

TIME -CO-RELATION OF CVRUFDR AND’ ATC TIMING

Time is not recorded on CVR. On UFDR frame

counter readings are recorded every second. These counter

readings ‘are used as time counter. To achieve co-relation.
between CYR and UFDR, some specific Points are required:
which can be identified on both CVR and UFDR. One of¢ the

standard methods used for co-relation 2s through the:

recording of VHF Keying parameter of UFDR. A transmission:

“from aircraft to ATC requires the use of Press—to-Talk (PTT)

switch. The UFDR records the use of PTT switch and this.

Parameter is known as VHF Keying. With the identification®

of the transmissions to ATC récorded on the CVR, it ish.

possible te tco-relate CVR transmissions with UFDR

recordings. With the same method, the CVR recordings and
ATC recordings can be corelated. The ATC recordings have a
time channel which records time in UTC. The time of ATC is
normally co-related to CVR and UFDR as it is a real time

clock.

As noticed above, the corelation of time as’

given in CVR Transcript (Ann.’A') and as given in the earli-

er part of this report in relation to EPR values only was o
the .basis of a full 38 minute Period recorded oan the EVR
Tt was,showever, felt essential to obtain more acturate
corelation which was possible if the UFDR data and CVE

done for 2@ minutes. Accordingly, the cCo-relation of CYR
transcript and UFDR data has been prepared as follows:~

A touch down sound of the Sth landing has been

recorded on CVR which is at 09:22:55 UTC. This touch down

can also be nermally identified on the “vertical eccelerag—

tion’ parameter recorded on UFDR. The vertical acceleration

is recorded 8 times ina second. UFDR read out shows that

‘touch down Was between frame No. 2888 and 28a9 during which

the vertical acceleration has a maximum peak of 1.35 6.

/This touch down point in the fe-relation = chart has been
taken as 8 second and all other timings (in seconds) are
from this touch down Point. This co-relation Chart is

Annexure ‘C' to this report. For better understanding the

frame number of UFDR read out have + been incorporated in

another co-relation Chart which is Annexure ’D’ to this

report.

CRASH POINT

In CVR the last touch down point after the Sth

circuit and the crash point is clearly recorded. The
time differences between thre two events from the exact
timings obtained by above method is 43.5 seconde. On
UFDR touch dewn point is identitied by the Sth record—
ing of vertical acceleration peak of 1.3.5 Gin frame
No.2868 i.e. half frame. ‘The last recording of UFDR is
till end of frame No.2931 which contains all good
recordings of vertical acceleration. Therefore, as per
UFDR the time differences between touch down and last
recording is (2932 minus 2866.5) 43.5 seconds. Instead
of taking 2931, the figure 2922 has been taken Since,
as stated above, the recording till the end of 2971
‘contains all good recording of vertical acceleration.
It stands clearly established that the time differences

from touch down to crash point is 43.5 seconds,

ENGINE PRESSURE RATIO (CEPR)

The fall in the value of EFR of the left
engine also stands fully established from the material
and data on record. . None of the participants including

counsel for Mrs.fhurana disputed the facts relating to

192


yen tre,

the fall of EPR value of th® left engine. The decline!’

in the left engine EFR started from UFDR Time 2989 and

it continued for 5 seconds i.e. upto time frame 2914,

In just 3 seconds (UFDR time trame 2719 to 2912)

there

has been about 28% drop in EFR value. During 5 seconds

from 2909 to 2914 the aircraft developed &@ positive

rate of climb and at UFDR time 2

Capt.Khurana  an-

nounced that he was putting the ‘gear up". The EPR
value of left engine is almost constant from UFDR time
2914 to 2917. The EPR value again started a drop) from

UFDR time 27917 and reached almost idle position at UFDR

time 2921. At UFDR time 2919 the unsafe landing confi-

Qration horn sounded. At UFDR time 2922 Capt.Khurana

called "Rudder, Rudder, Rudder". The aircraft rolled
severely to the left reaching an extreme of 101.9
degrees left wing down at FDR time 2925, Within

about

less than 2 seconds Capt.Khurana shouted "Na Na leave

leave”.

According to Mr. Mahajan, counsel for
Mrs.Khurana, the drop in EPR was not on account of,
retarding the left eigine thrust lever by Capt. Khurana
but if was an account of fuel starvation as a result of
malo functioning of Fuel Control Unit. According to
other participants the drop in EPR value ef left engine
was on account of retarding of left engine thrust lever

by Capt.Khturana. .

194


_ F.C.U. -

Mr.Mahajan suggests that the Fuel Control Unit

of the lett engine (Port engine) was not fully  func—

tional and the blockage of the fuel nozzles could have

led to the drop of EPR value.

. The aircraft had been subjected to 70 Checr in
“tS : ‘

USA -in.1993 before it was flown to India. Further, the

aircraft. had been subjected to: "C” check on &th March

1994 and it is in evidence that at that time the fuel

hozz2s. were cleaned. The Symptoms of Fuel starvation
in an aircraft specially on take off stage, when full
Power is applied, are typical. No attempt has been

made “in evidence to bring out the typical symptoms of

. fuel o starvation - or of blocked nozzles. Neither the
° ' . pilot nor the engineer witnesses have been asked spe-
~ sy cific and pointed questions on this aspect of symptoms
7 of fuel starvation. If FCU was not functioning or was

Roetos - mal functioning, as suggested by Mr.Mahajan during

submission, certainly there would have been some

indi-
cations in the Cockpit, It if not so, The FOU is a
condition monitored compenent,. According, to

Me.S.Krishnan the Quality Control Manager of Sahara,
whO appeared as a witness, the FOU is a condition
monitored component and had had done FEEQ hours

since

installation. Mr.Erishnan also stated that fuel nozzle

105


scleaning was done on 6th March, i994 at the time of c

Check. Tt is stated that it took about more than sae

man power to carry cut the C check in which more than

4@ persons were involved. According to Witness No.7

Mr. PK. Chhatopadhaya also the Fuel Nozzle Cleaning was

Carried out on &th March, 1994 and that the

value. On the other hand, if totai stoppage of fuel

miy a leakage of
fuel, it would not result in the EFR value dropping to

idle, In such an eventuality the drop in EPR can be

set off. by use of the throttle, The EPR has not

dropped abruptly but gradually. r+ may also be noticed

that while setting the take off Power of an engine, the

Crew is required to Open the throttle to the extent

that gives the required take off EPR SS per the atmos—

pheric condition. There is no evidence to shaw that

the engine did not develop the required power, If the

Compressor Delivery Frocess(CDF) line wes loose it

would have created & leak which would have required the

throttle to move further than that of Engine No.2?

there would certainly been a mention of it during the Us

.

~ Fer. Square Inch) of Engine No.1 and 11 FSI of Engine

~ No.2 is of mo cansequence and is not indicative of
looseness of CDF line causing drop in the performance.
Regarding suggested mal functioning of F & D value by
not tightening the input or sutput lines of the same by
oversight, it has to be noticed that these lines handle
fuel under a very high pressure and any looseness will
cause a very high fuel leak which cannot be missed and
in absence of any indication of it the mal functioning

od of fF & D value is ruled out. Further, such mal func—

tioning...would also,affect the starting of the engine

and there is no evidence to show that the starting of
the engine.was effected in any manner. There is.also no
evidence that there was any loud compressor’ soiled
noise since the sudden blockage of CDF line would have
resulted in such.a noise Which cannot be missed. No cas

such.sound has been recorded by CVR. The blockage . and

shearing of CDP line is ruled out.

The FCU was inspected by a Team of Experts at

Calcutta. The “FCU inspection report is Ex.3. The

inspection had taken place nearly 4 months after the

accident. The basis of submissicn af FCU malfunction—

U

ing is this report. lt se However « clear that

the FOU having been exposed to weathering a& part of
wreckage for aver four months must have got somewhat
further damaged. Even grass was formed inside it. It

cannot be that FCU was in such a condition on 6th Merch

1994 during the flight. The FOU. mal

functioning on

account of = D Cam wear/rusting during the. course of

Shop Test/Strip examination report (Ex.3) 8S nmeticed

above, would have been on account of exposure for about

4 months. If the condition of FCU, when it

stalled in the Aircraft, had been as mentioned in Ex

it weuld have certainly reflected in the performance of

the engine and the behaviour of the engine would have

been reported by the Filots of the Previous sectors.

Nothing of the kind was done. The consistent Operation
of the engine prior to the crash suggests that there

Was no mal functioning of FCU attributable to = D.Cam,
Toomay, however, mention that FCU being one of vital
component should net have been left on site and ought
to have preserved by the Inspector of Accidents to
avoid its exposure to weather conditions.

Mr.Mahajan submitted. that as per ‘OC check
schedule the removal and installation of Pap valves
requires that serial number of the Port and = starboard
valves should be inserted on the sheet.at the time of

removal as well as installation to ensure that there is

no intermixing af vaive

ut

of the port. and starboard
engine, Learned counsel also Pointed out that

neither the. “off. number’ nor ‘on

entered during the ‘ check, Tt

was iIn= 7


samples of engine 011 and sending the same for chemical

analysis and in -this case na such finding with regard
to result of such analysis has been recorded in the
"C’ Check schedule which would be essential to monitor
the possibility of a Power failure of the engine. It is

further pointed eut that there is a requirement of 5

seals for the purpose of carrying out © Check. Tt is
submitted that nowhere in the ‘°C check schedule it has
been stated whether the seals were actually procured
and changed. Tt is submitted that at the time of
installation of P & D valve in ‘&’ check seals have to
be. changed since the Seals cannot be reused omce the P
& D valve is removed. Tt has been inferred that use of
the old seals could certainly result in fuel leak/power

joss.

Though there may be substance in the
submission in regard to the maintenance of record as
pointed out by Mr.Mahajan, but this enly shows that
the record as is expected to be maintained by the
Operator at the time of carrying out °C’ check schedule
was not properly maintained. Nothing more than this
can be. inferred particularly keeping in view the obser—
vations made hereinbefore that assuming there was
leakage it would have affected the starting of the
engine and there is no evidence to show that the engine
was affected in any manner and also that the Impose FO &

D valve would have been noticed since these lines

1@9


handle £fui@l under a very heavy pressure and looseness

will cause a very high fuel leak which cannet be

missed. Therefore, the non maintenance of the record
Properly during ‘C’ check schedule is certainly an
irregularity ....but the same cannot be attributed as a

cause of the accident.
RUDDER CONTROL UNIT.

Mr.Mahajan then contended that it is possible
that rudder actuated piston in the aircraft may have
gone in a direction opposite to. the intended direction
resulting in reduced controlability of the Airtraft
which may have caused the accident. If that was so
there would certainly have been indication in the CYR
about the mal functioning of rudder, The call "rudder,
rudder, rudder" was made at UFDR time frame 2922 and

the crash occurred at the end of UFDR time frame

In this phase of 9 seconds or during about @ seconds
from the call ‘leave, leave’ to the time of erash there
is nothing . in CVR to suggest the mal functioning of
rudder whith is difficult to accept in case the rudder
was mal functioning and going in a direction Opposite

to intended sne.

Further the rudder FCU was examined in Indian

Airlines facilities and the test was found Setietacto—

118


ry. In the said test, however, the dual servo valve
manufactured by ‘M/e.Farkar Henifin could nat be
checked. The unit was also sent to M/s.FParkar Henifen.
The report of the said organisations establishes
beyond doubt that there had been no reversal of rudder

control. The report rules out any jam. In view of the

fact that there was no jam and also bearing in mind

ft

other aspects noticed above, the fact that dual serve

t

valve may have been changed by someone other than the
manufacturer, (a fact which could not be ascertained on
account of absence of the complete maintenance record
of the rudder unit) in any case, does not show the mal
functioning of rudder FCU. Tt (is, therefore,conciuded
that the mal functioning of rudder PCU has not been

established as a cause of the accident.

Two other aspects which were vaguely suggested
by learned counsel Mr.Mahajan may be also’ dealt with
here.

DISINTEGRATION

The first relates te disintegration of the
tail portion and/or port wing from the aircraft in air
bout 464 feet above

at round level. In that regard

Tm)

4

oO

it was also suggested that this disintegration woul

also explain the disruption ef power sunmply to UFBR/C
at the said sititude. Firstly, learned counsel is

assuming the disruption of power supply to UFDR/SCOVA

bo
ay


when the afrcraft was at about 464 feet above ground
level. ‘There is nothing to suggest that there was any
such disruption, The theory of disintegration of the
tail portion and/or port wing in air also dees not Find
any support from the material on record. [t may be
noticed that G loads had not exceeded 1.7 G, which is
well within the “G@° envelope of + 2 to - 1. The forces
created on the ill fated aircraft will not be strong
enough to cause disintegration. The speed was about

15@ knots only. It is well below the maximum speed of

35 knots. Aileron reversal will take place at the

maximum speed of about 250 knetes where the wing will

twist because of maximum deflection. Further, the
structural disintegration alse does not suggest ‘that
disintegration took place in the air. The accident
tdok place .during the day light. The aircraft was
noticed by the Staff at the Airport while it was in
air. No eye witness has come forth to state that the
aircraft disintegrated in air. The Portions of the
aircraft aforesaid were also found in the tarmac area
of the Airport. If the aircratt had disintegrated in
air these portions would have been found in a larger
area and would not have been localised in the tarmac
area. From all these accounts the disintegration of

the aircraft in air is completely ruled out.


WAKE VORTEX

The phenomenon of Wake Vortex which affects
the flow over the wings aor control surfaces when one

aircraft follows another aircraft has also no applica—

bility to the Present case. It has come in evidence

that the Wake Vortex effects are more lethal when the

aly

ircraft is landing because of the low. speed and this
Phenomenon ordinarily does not affect when the aircraft
is taking off because the aircraft is at full Power and
its speed is rapidly increasing and aircraft is gaining
height. The Sahara aircraft, being a medium aircraft,
did not land behind any heavy aircraft. The only
related air traffic was the take off by a medium air-
craft i.e, Avro, which preceded the take off of the
fateful aircraft by over 3 minutes. In the light of
the provisions contained in ICAO DOC 4444 the time is

longer than what

the aircraft had started increasina:

101.7% degrees at frame No.2928) which subsequently
reduced. to about 46 degrees( Minus 59.38 degrees at
frame No.2936);

B) The aircraft attained the maximum height of
498 feet above ground level in about 37.5 seconds. from

the teuch dewn (Fre

and started descending

thereafter:

_ 9) The stick shaker warning started at about 39,5

ws , 144


seconds from touch down (Frame No.2928) and remained
till the crash. At the time of initiation. of stick
shaker warning, roll angle of the aircraft was at its
maximum of 1@1.9 degrees to the left and the pitch
attitude was about 8 degrees nose downs...

id) At the time of crash the speed of the aircraft
was increasing and was uround i5@ knots. The attitude
of the aircraft was about 19 degrees nose down and

about 76 degrees to the left bank. The EFR of Engine

No.1 shows slight increase in value.

In order to understand the crew action the '
aforesaid aspects would have to be kept in mind. I may
also notice that the altitude reading on the UFDR shows
that the aircraft was about more than 489 feet above

ground level at Frame No. 2931. The altitude reading

after Frame No. 2926 cannot be accepted as valid.
Beside the reasons already noticed earlier, it has to
be borne in mind that the values of the corrected roli
angle recorded in the Frame No. 2926 have shown the
increase in the left bank from 58.97 gegrees to 81.12
Gegrees; the values of corrected roll angles in Frame

No. 2927 shows a left bank ef more than 9@ degrees and

these values show abnormal attitude and have probably
affected the altitude value. The velue of the altitude
recorded in Frame No. 2926 is 1257.7 feet which is
about 498 feet above ground level and is the maximum

height gained by the aircraft. “ne crash is about 6&6


rare

seconds later.-- The height of 498 feet was lost in six
seconds. The average rate of decend during the period
works out to be (498 « 60/46) equal to 498@ feet per
minute. Further, the corrected roll readings recorded

on the UFDR show that the aircraft has remained in that

altitude of more than 9@ degrees for 2 seconds i.e.

during the Frame Ne. and ‘Boand thereafter at
has started recovering in the next two frames. rt
is,therefore, appropriate that the altitude curve

should have a higher rate of decend in the first two
seconds anda little less rate of decend thereafter.
The altitude curve obtained in Run 22 of Boeing simula—
tor shows similar features as incorporated in the
Charts € and D and shown as dotted Line. The rate of
decend during the first two seconds is about 5168 feet
per minute and thereafter reduced to about 40880 feet
per minute and the average, as notice earlier, works
out to be 4980 feet per minute. For this purpose the
average rate of decend of 7508 feet per minute given-by
the Boeing is not being accepted as the same was worked
out on the basis of simulated data as opposed toe UFDR

data.

The pitch and the bank altitudes in a ‘stalled

condition of the aircraft also suggest that the air-

craft must have been falling freely under gravity. Tt
would be like a stone falling. If a stone
!

116


falls under gravity from a height of 498 feet, it would
take about 5.6 seconds and its average rate of decend
would be about 5236 feet per minute. The free fall of
stone assumes that a stone is falling in vaccum i.e.
without. air... The presence of air would slightiy in-
crease the timings. The tall of the aircraft in the
last few seconds, therefore, can be compared with a
free fall. Having regard to all these facts and, in
particular, the fact of left bank of more than FO
degrees with nose down and side slip, it is not possi-~
-ble to accept that the aircraft after time frame 2926
was gaining height. In this view the altitude reading

after time frame 2926, as given in UFDR data, deserves

to be ignored.

In the first 5 teuch and go exercises there is
no abnormality. The aircraft had gone to Bangalore and
flew back from Bangalore ta Delhi and the CVF does not

+ . suggest of any problem. Now let us consider why cer-
tain calls other than normal and routine calls, as
reftected in CVR, were made and what we can derive

therefrom.

The first call out after feuch down and hefore
Rotate call is "Ke gal ae yaar chal straight runway
~ seeda lagana’ on UTC time @9:22:58. These call outs
~ are by Capt.khurana. The reasons for these call outs

~ are not far to seek. Before touch down time ©9:19:29

117


till touch down at time frame 09:72:55, it appears that
the flight has been very unsteady as is evident from

the following:—

1) Late on the final turn to capture localiser.
=) Unsteady in height keeping.
3} Unsteady on localiser and glide siope.
4) Trimming poor.
=) Flaps 28-48 units at the high speed of 178
knots.
6) Speed going below Bug speed.
The call ‘Ke gal ae yaar, chal straight,

rm

runway seeda lagana’ can be on accoun of aforesaid
factors coupled.with the fact that the landing was not
straight on the centre of the runways though it may be,

within the permissible limits.

rotate call is ‘Neth-

The next call out
ing is happening’ followed by the call ‘let us see what

to do now’. It seems that Capt. Khurana had something

calls were made

im his mind when
the EFR of Engine No.1 immediately after these calls
throws considerable light as te the state of mind of
Capt. Khurana at that time. When aforesaid calls are
evaluated with the drog in EPR of left Engine, it would

appear that probably fCapt. Khurana, at that time, was


thinking “of giving single engine failure simulation.
“The static value of EPR of left Engine after the call
‘Gear up’ for about 4 seconds only shows that for
putting the gear up, Capt.Ehurana lifted his hand from
throttle lever to the landing gear lever to move it to
“up position’ and thereafter again started retarding
the throttie. These calis cannot be attributed aS
suggested by Mr.Mahajan te something being wrong with
the aircraft. Had it been so it would have been
clearly spelt out in CVR, Further, if Capt.Khurana had
found something amiss in the aircraft, he would not
have, looking to his long flying experience, thought of

giving emergency exercise to Capt.Vidul Mahajan.

The horn sound was recorded around 30.5 sec-—
onds from the touch down. It is evident that the
trainee pilot had net used the rudder. The horn sound
was on account of unsafe landing configration when Flap
position was 15 and the gear was not down and one
threttie had been retarded. Immediately after the horn
sound, within = seconds Capt.Khurana shouts “Rudder,

pilot to
apply which rudder. The aircraft was already rolling
ta the left gradually and after the call “Na, Na,
Leave, Leave’, the rate of roil had increased sharply
as neticed above. The maximum roil was about 102
degrees. In this state of affairs it appears that the

trainee pilotf instead of applying the right rudder,

119


sapolied the left rudder with the result that the- rate
of roll sharply increased inviting the call from Ehura—
na ‘’Na, Na, Leave, Leave’ between time frame 2924 and

2929 and stick shaker warning at time frame 2926. The

roll showed an improvement and was reduced to about 48
degrees on frame No. 2930. This shows that an attempt

the unfrotunate crash tock place.

The slight increase in the EPR of Engine No.l

aveid crash threttle may have been moved forward about

2 to 3 seconds earlier.

the failure of the engine on account of some defect in

In the “present case, the trainees were on the very
first day, put on aircraft, with an instructor who had
not himself. imparted simulator training to,.the train—
ees, and then a single engine failure exercise was
given and that too when the performance of trainees on
simulator was not of very high standard. The giving of
such exercise was certainly not advisable and a prudent
act. But for this exercise, the crash was avoidable.
Capt.Tripathi says that by way of abundant caution he

had briefed Capt.Khurana not to undertake any emergency

exercises ‘in the training flight. How much can

Capt.Tripathi be relied upon on /this particular aspect


is another matter which would be dealt with at
appropriate stage in later part of this report but his
statement that if Capt.Khurana was Planning to do
Single engine failure, it should have been done on the
down wind so that in case of an error the same could
have been sately rectified, deserves due weightage, not
only because the statement is coming from a highly
experienced person but also for the reason that this
seems to be even otherwise generally accepted position
which emerges: from Opinion. of most of the pilots, and
there is hardly any contrary opinion. Capt.Tripathi

also says that looking at the level of the experience
of the trainee, Capt. Khurana should have guarded the
control lest it is interfered with inadvertently by the
trainee pilot. ‘There cannot be any doubt that while

giving single ‘engine -failure; on the given facts,

Capt.Ehurana showld have blocked the rudder control so

that the trainee Pilot does not apply the wrong rudder.

I,therefore, conclude that, in the present

case, in the first instance, the Single engine failure
exercise should not have been given. In any case, ait
should have been given on down wind in nermal circuit,
Further, even’ when it’ was given on take off, at the
altitude at which it was given, Capt. fhurana ehouid

have jrocked the rudder so as to rule out the possibil-

ity of application of wrong rudder by the trainee.

found in the corporate management- commercial pressures

the Conference of Directors General of Civil Aviation,

Sahara and. DGCA in this respect.

The moderi aircraft systems and

operating

Procedures are generally failure tolerent and exhibit
sufficient redundency and safeguards to Cope adequately
with ‘engine failure-be it human or mechanical. The

greater risk is the organisational failure. The seri

ous incident or accident is more often than “not a
symptom of the failure somewhere in the system. The
failures may take place by mistake- indeed most hazard—
Sous errors will involve the violation of..some opera-

tional rule or instructions. But violations can also

be deliberate and in this case the reason can surely be

on flight crew and lack of tare and supervision being

obvious motivator( See paper presented by Hong Kong in

Asia and Pacific Region held at Pinang, Malaysia from
8th to 14th September 1994).

As stated earlier, the aspects including that

of failure of management and regulatory body would be

examined and dealtiwith under this head. I would first
examine and deal with the matter of grant of approval

“ Capt.Khurana did not fulfill condition of sub clause

Civ) of Clause 2.2 of Ex.%, namely, Criteria for Ap-—

«proval of Examiners/Instructors/Check, Pilots for A@ir-—

. that Capt.Khurana neither had the experience of one

of Capt.Arora that Capt. Khurana did not fulfill the
conditions necessary when he sent letter dated 28th

Stated in his letter that Capt.Khurana had completed
all the formalities. Since the letter dated 28th
February 1994 was written knowing that Capt.Khurana was
not eligible to act as an instructor a pointed question
was asked to Capt.Arora that, did he write that letter

* en his own account or he wrote it because his employer

wanted him to write such a letter. The demeanour of

be noticed. Capt.Arora after taking considerable time
in answering this question and even thereafter, with
lot of hesitation, took the burden of. writing the
letter onto himself and absolved his employer,
Capt.Arora is still in the employment of Sahara. The

reasons for his aforesaid answer are not far to seek,

Capt.Arora said that although he knew that Capt.k

lacked the experience as per criteria but he wrote the

said letter and stated in that letter that Capt.Khurana

‘the Airline had no instructor. When asked as to wheth-
er. he had reported about what he had stated in letter
dated 28th February 1994 to his senior executive in the
company, namely, Mr.Uttam Kumar Bose, firstly with
hesitation Capt.Arora stated that he had reported that

to Mr.Bose but again changed stating that he hed not

reported it to Mr.Bose and it was purely his own deci-—-

sion.

_Capt.Khurana, according to Capt.Arora did mot fulfill

Director of Training and Licensing in DGCA, says that

Capt.Khurana fulfilled condition No.4 of clause 2.2 of

approved check pilot of

Ex.9 and had experience as
one year. This he says because Capt.Khurana was ap-
proved as check pilot for the first time on 7th April
1992 while he was in Indian Airlines. According to the
testimony of Mr.Sardana, the period. of one year would
start from 7th April 1992. Mr.Sardana also states that
in case of grant of approval to Capt.Khurana to act as
an -instructor, power. of relaxation was not exercised.
According to Mr.Sardana the experience of one ‘year

after approval as check pilot is sufficient even though

the’ concerned pilot may not have acted as check pilot |

“at aY2e-°Mr.Sardana further states..that period of . one

about relaxation. The letter dated 28th February’ 1994

also does not state that approval in case of

and as such he was not fulfilling the regirement of

be Fave a BR

Department of Civil Aviation can waive this condition.

Except for Capt.Tripathi no one has

talked about waiver
or relaxation of condition regarding experience of one
year as check pilot. It has also come on record that
upto 28th February 1994 when the letter seeking approv—
al was sent, Capt.Khurana had conducted only two checks
though the DGCA was informed that he had conducted 6
checks. Later, after the accident Sahara said that he
had conducted 4 checks. Even out of these four checks,
admittedly two checks were conductred after 28th Febru-
ary 1994, DGCA.could not be aware about these two
checks when it granted approval on file on 4th March

“1994, One check was on 4th March 1994 and another on
zo

5th March 1994. After his release as check Pilot the

‘only two checks conducted by Capt.Khurana befor

ing letter dated 28th February 1994 were twa,

on 25th January 1994 i.e. of Capt.S.C.Tripathi, and on
28th January 1994 of Capt.a.K.Chadha. It is strange
that Sahara informed DSCA that Capt.Khurana had con-

ducted six checks. The DGCA should have also cross

checked.

According to Mr.Sardana it is immaterial
whether during the period of one year, the check pilot
exercises the privileges of Check pilot or not and on
the same analogy it would also be immaterial if after
grant of _approval for one year or for a substantial

part thereef the pilot remains sick or does not fly at

al) for any other reason and still as Per the under—
““standing of the Department, he would fulfill the condi
tion of one year experience of check pilet as contem—
Plated by clause 7.2(4) of Ex.9. This understanding of

Mr.Sardana and of the Department, to say the least, is

} )
I

absolutely against not only the plain language of the

clause requiring experience but is a

SO against the

ebject and purpose of the clause. In the hier

chy of
fliers the position of instructor is very vital and
e important. The instructor has to teach flying. I : :
7 " suppose with a@ purpose it must have been stipulated

that a check pilot with experience as check pilot of

one year, would be eligible to be considered for grant

of approval as instructor. It implies that one has to

exercise privileges of a check pilet before being

_ ' " considered = for approval as instructor. According to
~ “- the understanding . of the Department as discloead by
_ , Mr.Sardana a pilot. would be said to be fulfilling
~ Clause 2.2(4) after approval of DSCA even though he is
_ not released/appointed as check Pilot by the Airline
~ : and even though he is not flying at all for one reason
ret oe “or the other. Such an understanding did not ev find

- favour with the fliers as is evident ¢rom the testimony

~ of Capt.Arora and Capt:Tripathi.

a ~ During the pendency gt these proceedings by

issue of AIC dated Sth December 1994 requiremest et


"Sahara. It was all done with Modiluft. Regarding

clause 2.2 has been changed in regard to the experience
as. check pilot. The existing clause of experience of
one year as check pilot has been withdrawn and in its
place the requirement of 1@ checks has been provided
for. The AIC now issued doés not now - etipulate any
experience as check pilot before one can be considered

for approval as instructor. This has its own fallouts.

It is appropriate thet now it has been provided that a

FH

check pilot should have conducted 1@ checks before he
is considered eligible for approval as instructor. In
view of the fact that in a given circumstance, i@
checks can be completed in short span of even 2-3 days, -
it may not be proper to completely do away with experi-
ence. It would be desirable to combine both the period
of experience and requisite number of checks. Keeping

in view the safety required in aviation matters doing

away. with one year experience does not appear to be

appropriate.

There is also another aspect of approval of
Capt.Khurana as instructor. Admittediy, . Cant.Khurana

condition, the responsibility on the shoulders of ‘“DErA

is greater. Mr.Sardana states that the Operators are
not required to obtain approval of DECA for their

Training Manual. Tt is only required to be submitted
to DGCA. Toam informed that during the Bendency of
these proceedings necessary circular requiring approval
of DGCA for Training Manual has been issued. It ig re

guired to be noticed that though DGCA granted approval
on 4th March/8th March 1994 it did not knew as to what
was the syllabus for necessary training and satisfacto—

ry test of Sahara for their instructor. It was not ia

happy state of affair but nothing more is required to

be said now since after the accident Sahara submitted
their Training Manual sometime in May 1994 which: has

since been approved.

Capt.Khurana had moved on from one Airlines to

lines in i992,

East West Airlines and joined Modiluft and finally

Sahara on 3rd November i993. Though DGCA had granted

approval for. Capt. Khurana to act as a Check Pilot in
Indian Airlines but before he could be given necessary

training and perform the functions of Check Filet, he

It seems that it was made after .the crash. Who could
be interested in creating such a evidence except the

employer.

Even after -the- accident ang alse during the
course af the inguiry the conduct of the Airlines has

not been straight forward. 1+ is evident thet

wy

ahara
made up its mind that it was a case of simulated engine
failure as early as on 9th March 1994 when an insertion
in newspaper Ex.15 was given Justifying that such an

exercise was necessary. The point is not whether such

van xercise -was necessary or not. For the Present,

the point is, that having taken that Position Sahara
should have been straight forward in its stand. In-

stead of doing that, they took absolute converse stand

in these proceedings to the effect that Capt.Ehurana

was briefed by Capt.Tripathi in the Presence of
Capt.Arora that no emergency e@xercise should be given
during the course of the training flight. This stand
SSSumes such an exercise was not necessary. To Justify
that stand = further and having been contronted with
Ex.iS, Gahara came forward with escape route in the
form of evidence of witness Mr.A.K.Ohri. His testimony

ie utterly unconvincing and not at ali reliable. -it is

inconceiveable that Ex.iS would have been Given without

consulting Officer

in

lite Capt. Srora and Capt. Tripathi

t

her senior officers and in fact on the instruc—

and oo

147


mr

‘

tions of such Officers. In view of the totality o¢
these circumstances it is also not conceivable that
Capt.ehurana was briefed not to Give any emergency

exercise in the

training flight,

In this CAS@s 48 15 apparent from afore

te

the lack of Proper corporate management seems evident
when one bears in mind the manner in which the approval
of D6cA for Capt.Khurana to act as instructor was
sought and the manner in which the training flight was
“planned and executed before even receipt of formal
approval from DECA. Commercial Pressure also is evi-
dent from the testimony of Capt.Arora when he says that
the Airline was in the need of an instructor and that
is the reason that he made application ¢or his approval
knowing well that Capt.Ehurana was not eligible. It is
not possible to accept though he has taken the burden
on himself to believe that he did it without the knowl—

edge, consent or at the instance o¢ his superiors

In the Newspapers of 1Bth March 1994 the ~

advertisement Ex.iS issued by Sahara Was published
which suggests that an engine failure Exercise was given
in the training flight in question with a view to Give

eut that such type of typic

ty

tly dynamic training exer—
cises were mandatory requirement by the stetutory

authorities, This advertisement came to light only

148


whem evidence was being recorded.* The advertisement
was brought on record during the croes examination of
Mr.S.Erishnan on 15th November 1994, Mr. krishnan,
however, stated that he could not gay who geve the
insertion Ex.15 in the newspaper. The witness was
directed on 15th November 1794 to place an record the
Basis on which Ex.i5 was Qiven in the newspaper, This
led to filing of affidavit dated 22nd November 1694 by
Witness No.i2 Mr.Ashok Kumar Ohri who is Incharge for

all media releases on behalf of the Company. He is not

an. expert in flying. In fact, he does not know any—

thing about flying and also much about the requirement
of DGCA. He has taken upon himself the entire Durden
ef issue of Ex.iS. This document, inter-alia, gives an
impression that power of one engine had been reduced to

zero in the ill-fated flight and Sahara knew about it

on 6th March, 1994 and alse that such an exercise was
necessary. When asked as to how he reached the said
fenclusion, an utterly LACORVINcine and unsatisfactory
reply was given that when he had gone to Airport on Sth

March 1994, he overheard certain people saying that the

HT]

Power of one engine had heen reduced to rero and that
is how he stated about reduction of power in the Press
release and he did not discuss about it with either
Capt.Arora or Capt.Tripathi or any other persan in
Sahara about the

gines. He is sai

shows that Sahara had made up the mind soon after the

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I did not know much about field of
~Flying—when-—I--gave consent for performing the
functions of Court of Inguiry. In fact, let me
concede that I had no knowledge about the techni-
Cal aspects of flying or other technical aspects
of civil aviation. It would not have been possi-
ble’ to make this report but for the able assist-—
ance, guidance and help received from various
persons. This report would be incomplete without

my expressing gratitude to thea.

Air Commodore R.P.S.Garcha, one of the
Assessors is not only a senior and experienced
Flier/Pilot but is also highly knowledgeable in
the field of flying and hard working. Likewise,
the ether assessor Mr.R.D. Thakur, General Manager
(Engineering) in Indian Airlines, with his deep
knowledge, devotion and hard work was able to
explain to me the technical engineering aspects in
a simple manner sa that I wes able to understand
these aspects without much cifficuity. Tt has
been a great pleasure ta be associated with Air

Commodore Garcha and Mr.Thakur.

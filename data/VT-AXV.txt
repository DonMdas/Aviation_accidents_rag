Executive Summary                                                                  Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Executive Summary 
 
 
 
Air India Express operates a scheduled Quick Turn Around (QTA) flight        
IX-811/812 daily, on sector Mangalore-Dubai-Mangalore. On 21st / 22nd May 2010, a 
similar flight was operated by Capt Z Glusica and First Officer H S Ahluwalia, along 
with 4 Cabin crew. As per the schedule, the crew had been given adequate time to 
rest. The outbound flight IX-811 was uneventful. The aircraft was refuelled and 
released from Dubai after transit checks. The aircraft was serviceable except for two 
defects of minor nature carried forward under Minimum Equipment List (MEL), one 
for passenger seat 25C and another for Right Hand Tail Logo Light.  
 
Subsequently, the same crew had operated flight IX-812 on 22nd May 2010 
from Dubai to Mangalore. On this flight, there were 160 passengers including           
4 infants. The flight chocked off from Dubai at 02:36 hours IST. As indicated in the 
DFDR, the take-off, climb and cruise were uneventful. 
 
The aircraft first came in contact with the Mangalore Area Control at 05:32:52 
hours IST, when it was approaching the reporting point IGAMA, at FL-370. The 
Mangalore Area Control Radar (MSSR) was unserviceable since 20th May 2010 and 
a NOTAM to this effect had been issued.  
 
The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), which had recorded conversation for the 
last 2 hours and 05 minutes for this flight, indicated that there was ‘no conversation’ 
between the two pilots for the first 1 hour and 40 minutes and that the Captain was 
asleep with intermittent sounds of snoring and deep breathing.   
 
Mangalore airport has a Table Top runway. Owing to the surrounding terrain, 
Air India Express has made a special qualification requirement that only the Pilot in 
Command (PIC) shall carry out takeoff and landing.  
 
The aircraft was cleared to descend at 77 DME from Mangalore at 05:47:34 
hours IST. The visibility was 6 km and the aircraft was advised to carry out an        
ILS DME Arc approach for R/W 24. 
 
It is evident from the investigation that the flight crew had failed to plan the 
descent profile properly, due to which the aircraft was high and did not intercept the 
ILS Glide Slope from below, which is the standard procedure. This led to the aircraft 
being at almost twice the altitude on finals, as compared to a standard ILS approach. 
In the ensuing ‘Unstabilised Approach’, the First Officer gave three calls to the 
Captain to ‘Go Around’. Also, there were a number of EGPWS warnings of SINK 
RATE and PULL UP. 
 
Despite the EGPWS warnings and calls from the First Officer to ‘Go Around’, 
the Captain had persisted with the approach in unstabilised conditions. The final 
touch down of the aircraft was at about 5200 ft from the beginning of R/W 24, leaving 
only about 2800 ft to the end of paved surface, to stop the aircraft. 
__________________________________________________________________ 
 
Note: 1. For the purpose of this report the timings have been converted to IST i.e. UTC + 5:30 hours 
e.g. 21:06 UTC is equal to 02:36 IST (next day). 
 
2. Dubai Local Time is UTC plus 4 hours or IST minus 1 hour 30 minutes. 
Executive Summary                                                                  Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Soon after the touchdown, the Captain had selected Thrust Reverser. But, 
within a very short time of applying brakes, the Captain had initiated a rather delayed             
‘go around’ or an attempted take-off, in contravention to Standard Operating 
Procedure (SOP) laid down by the manufacturer i.e. Boeing Commercial Airplane 
Company, USA. 
 
The aircraft overshot the runway and its right wing impacted ILS localiser 
antenna mounting structure. Thereafter, aircraft hit the airport boundary fence and 
fell into a gorge. Due to impact and fire, the aircraft was destroyed. In this tragic 
accident, 152 passengers and all 6 crew members lost their lives. There were only 8 
survivors. The investigation determines that there were no airworthiness issues with 
the aircraft and there was no sign of bird strike or any evidence of sabotage.  
 
Direct cause of the Accident: 
 
The Court of Inquiry determines that cause of this accident was the 
Captain’s failure to discontinue the ‘unstabilised approach’ and his 
persistence in continuing with the landing, despite three calls from the First 
Officer to ‘go around’ and a number of warnings from EGPWS.  
 
The contributory factors were: 
 
(a) 
In spite of availability of adequate rest period prior to the flight, 
the Captain was in prolonged sleep during flight, which could have led 
to sleep inertia. As a result of relatively short period of time between his 
awakening and the approach, it possibly led to impaired judgment. This 
aspect might have got accentuated while flying in the Window of 
Circadian Low (WOCL). 
 
 
(b)  
In the absence of Mangalore Area Control Radar (MSSR), due to 
un-serviceability, the aircraft was given descent at a shorter distance on 
DME as compared to the normal. However, the flight crew did not plan 
the descent profile properly, resulting in remaining high on approach.   
 
(c)  
Probably in view of ambiguity in various instructions empowering 
the ‘co-pilot’ to initiate a ‘go around’, the First Officer gave repeated 
calls to this effect, but did not take over the controls to actually 
discontinue the ill-fated approach. 
 
The recommendations and safety issues in this report focus on Fatigue Risk 
Management System (FRMS) especially for flights carried out during Window of 
Circadian Low (WOCL), Crew Resource Management (CRM), Flight Safety 
counselling, runway excursions and regulations for employment of foreign pilots, to 
name a few. The recommendations have been made to the operator, Air India 
Express, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and to the Regulator, Directorate General 
of Civil Aviation (DGCA).   
 
The Court of Inquiry has also recommended setting up of an independent 
Indian Civil Aviation Safety Board (ICASB) urgently in view of rapid growth of 
aviation in the country. Such independent safety organisations have been set up in 
USA, UK, Canada, France and Indonesia to name a few. The proposed ICASB will 
focus on all flight safety related issues to suggest proactive measures, to minimise 
accidents and incidents.

1.1 
History of Flight 
 
Air India Charters Limited operates a low-cost airline, under the brand name of 
Air India Express. It operates a scheduled Quick Turn Around (QTA) flight              
IX-811/812 daily, on sector Mangalore-Dubai-Mangalore. The Scheduled Time of 
Departure (STD) of flight IX-811 from Mangalore is 21:35 hours IST and STD for 
flight IX-812 from Dubai is 01:15 hours Local Time (02:45 hours IST). The Scheduled 
Time of Arrival of flight IX-812 at Mangalore is 06:30 hours IST, thereby, a 
substantial portion of return flight falls in period of Window of Circadian Low (WOCL).   
 
 
On 21st / 22nd May 2010, Air India Express operated Boeing 737-800 aircraft 
VT-AXV for a similar flight from Mangalore to Dubai and back. Capt Z Glusica and 
First Officer H S Ahluwalia, along with 4 Cabin Crew operated the flight. As per the 
schedule, the crew had been given adequate time to rest.  
 
Due to non-availability of a Medical Officer, the crew was not subjected to any 
pre-flight medical check prior to departure from Mangalore. However, the 
engineering personnel, who interacted with the Captain and the First Officer while 
seeing off the flight IX-811 from Mangalore, stated that both the pilots appeared to 
be healthy and normal. They also stated that both these pilots had carried out all  
pre-departure checks and start up procedure as per the standard practice. In 
addition, as indicated on the DFDR, the outbound flight IX-811 was uneventful and 
landed at Dubai at 23:44 hours Local Time (01:14 hours IST).  
 
During a halt of 1 hour and 22 minutes at Dubai, the Air India Commercial Staff 
as well as maintenance personnel from Oman Air and the ground staff of DNATA, to 
whom these functions are outsourced; reported to have seen both the Captain and 
First Officer having gone to the terminal building and duty free shop. These 
personnel had indicated that both of them appeared normal and there was nothing 
unusual in their behaviour. Being a QTA flight, as per regulations, no pre-flight 
medical was required at Dubai. 
 
The ground staff had carried out the turnaround servicing and refuelling with 
total fuel for the Sector of 13,900 kg including 1,600 kg of fuel for ‘tankering’. Two 
minor snags, which included un-serviceability of Passenger Seat No 25 C and Right 
Hand Tail Logo Light, were carried forward under MEL from the previous flight. 
Subsequently, the same crew operated flight IX-812 on 22nd May 2010 from Dubai to 
Mangalore. On this flight, there were 160 passengers including 4 infants. The flight 
chocked off from Dubai at 01:06 hours Local Time (02:36 hours IST), 09 minutes 
before the Scheduled Departure Time. As indicated in the DFDR, the take-off, climb 
and cruise were uneventful.

Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

The aircraft first came in contact with the Mangalore Area Control on frequency 
127.55 MHz at 05:32:48 hours IST, when it was approaching the Reporting Point 
IGAMA, at FL-370. The Mangalore Area Radar (MSSR) was unserviceable since 
20th May 2010 and a NOTAM to this effect had been issued. The First Officer, who 
was making all the R/T calls, requested for Radar Identification to which, he was 
informed regarding un-serviceability of the Radar. 
 
The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), which normally records conversation for a 
minimum period of last two hours of the flight (2 hours, 05 minutes for this flight), 
indicated that there was ‘no conversation’ between the two Pilots for the first 1 hour 
and 40 minutes of recording and the Captain was asleep with intermittent sounds of 
snoring, deep breathing and towards the end of this period, sound of clearing throat 
and coughing. The First Officer was making all the Radio Calls.  
 
The aircraft reported position at IGAMA at 05:33:20 hours IST. Approximately 5 
minutes later, the First Officer asked for the type of approach to which the ATC 
replied ILS DME Arc approach. At about 130 miles from Mangalore, the aircraft 
requested for descent clearance. This was, however, denied by the ATC Controller, 
who was using standard procedural control, to ensure safe separation with other air 
traffic. At 05:46:54 hours IST, aircraft reported its position when it was at 80 DME on 
radial 287 MML, as instructed by Mangalore Area Control. The aircraft was cleared 
to 7000 ft and commenced descent at 77 DME from Mangalore at 05:47:34 hours 
IST. The visibility reported was 6 km. 
 
Mangalore airport has a Table Top Runway. The airport is at Latitude            
12º 57’ 43.40” N, Longitude 074º 53’ 23.20” E with elevation of 101.629 meters above 
mean sea level. Owing to the surrounding terrain, Air India Express had made a 
special qualification requirement that only the PIC shall carry out the take off and 
landing.  Captain Glusica had made a total of 16 landings in the past at this airport 
and First Officer Ahluwalia, who was stationed at Mangalore, had operated as a    
Co-pilot on 66 flights at this airport.  
 
While the aircraft had commenced descent, there was no recorded 
conversation regarding the mandatory preparation for descent and landing briefing 
as stipulated in the SOP. Prior to the descent, there were some in-audible and 
intermittent sounds from the Captain’s Channel on the CVR. This was first time that 
the CVR had indicated that there was any intra-cockpit conversation between the 
two pilots.  After the aircraft was at about 50 miles and descending out of FL 295, the 
conversation between the two pilots indicated that an incomplete approach briefing 
had been carried out. 
 
At about 25 nm from DME and descending through FL 184, the Mangalore 
Area Controller cleared the aircraft to continue descent to 2900 ft.  At this stage, the 
First Officer requested, if they could proceed directly to Radial 338° and join the     
10 DME Arc. Through out the descent profile and DME Arc Approach for ILS 24, the 
aircraft was much higher than normally expected altitudes. 
 
The aircraft was handed over by the Mangalore Area Controller to ATC Tower 
at 05:52:43 hours IST. The ATC, thereafter, asked the aircraft to report having 
established on 10 DME Arc for ILS R/W 24.  
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Considering that this flight was operating in WOCL, by this time the First Officer 
had also shown signs of tiredness. This was indicated by the sounds of yawning 
heard on the CVR.     
 
On having reported 10 DME Arc, the ATC Tower had asked aircraft to report 
when established on ILS. It appears that the Captain had realised that the aircraft 
altitude was higher than normal and had selected Landing Gear ‘DOWN’ at an 
altitude of approximately 8,500 ft with speedbrakes still deployed in Flight Detent 
position, so as to increase the rate of descent. As indicated by the DFDR, the aircraft 
continued to be high and did not follow the standard procedure of intercepting the 
ILS Glide Path at the correct intercept altitude. This in-correct procedure led to the 
aircraft being at almost twice the altitude as compared to a Standard ILS Approach.  
 
During approach, the CVR indicated that the Captain had selected Flaps 40° 
and completed the Landing Check List. At 06:03:35 hours IST at about 2.5 DME, the 
Radio Altimeter had alerted an altitude of 2500 ft. This was immediately followed by, 
the First Officer giving a call of “IT IS TOO HIGH” and “RUNWAY STRAIGHT 
DOWN”. In reply, the Captain had exclaimed “OH MY GOD”. At this moment, the 
Captain had disconnected the Auto Pilot and simultaneously increased the rate of 
descent considerably to establish on the desired approach path. At this stage, the 
First Officer had queried “GO AROUND?” 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Diagram 2: Plan View of DME Arc Approach Leading to ILS 
 
To this query from the First Officer, the Captain had called out “WRONG 
LOC….. LOCALISER ….. GLIDE PATH”. It appears from the above that the Captain 
had realised the error and his subsequent correction indicated that he was not 
incapacitated.  
 
The First Officer had given a second call to the Captain for “GO AROUND” 
followed by “UNSTABILISED”. However, the First Officer did not appear to take any 
action, to initiate a Go Around. Having acquired the R/W visually and to execute a 
landing, it appears that the Captain had increased the rate of descent to almost    
4000 ft per minute. Due to this, there were numerous warnings from EGPWS for 
‘SINK RATE’ and ‘PULL UP’.     
 
 On their own, the pilots did not report having established on ILS Approach. 
Instead, the ATC Tower had queried the same. To this call, the Captain had 
forcefully prompted the First Officer to give a call of “AFFIRMATIVE”. The ATC 
Tower gave landing clearance thereafter and also indicated “WINDS CALM”.  
 
As per the ATC Controller, the aircraft was high on approach and touched down 
on the runway, much farther than normal. This was also substantiated by other 
witnesses such as RFF Crew and AME of Air India Express awaiting arrival of this 
aircraft, at the apron. As per the DFDR, aircraft had crossed the threshold at about 
200 ft altitude with indicated speed in excess of 160 kt, as compared to 50 ft with 
target speed of 144 kt for the landing weight.  
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Despite the EGPWS warnings and calls from the First Officer to go around, the 
Captain had persisted with the approach in unstabilised conditions. Short of 
Touchdown, there was yet another (Third) call from the First Officer, this time on 
VHF Channel “GO AROUND CAPTAIN” followed by “WE DON’T HAVE RUNWAY 
LEFT” on the intercom. However, the Captain had continued with the landing and the 
final Touchdown was about 5200 ft from the threshold of R/W 24, leaving 
approximately 2800 ft of remaining paved surface. 
 
Diagram 3: Approach Profile Including Salient Recordings from CVR  
 
The Captain had selected Thrust Reversers soon after touchdown. It was 
evident from the DFDR and wreckage examination that the Auto Brake selection was 
at position 2. As per the DFDR, within 6 seconds of applying brakes, the Captain had 
initiated a ‘Go Around’, in contravention of Boeing SOP.  
 
The aircraft overshot the runway including the strip of 60 metres. There is a 
downward slope from end of R/W 24 towards the boundary fence. After overshooting 
the R/W and strip, the aircraft continued into the Runway End Safety Area (RESA) of 
90 metres. Soon after which, the right wing impacted the localiser antenna structure 
located further at 85 metres from the end of RESA (60+90+85=235 Metres). 
Thereafter, the aircraft hit the boundary fence and fell into a gorge. During the entire 
period of CVR and ATC Tape recording, there was no emergency call from the 
aircraft indicating any type of failure. This was also substantiated by the analysis of 
DFDR Data. 
 
The ATC Controller was not able to see the aircraft at the end of R/W 24. 
However at 06:05:04 hours IST, ATC Controller had radioed the aircraft to back track 
as per the standard practice. The last recording on CVR was an aural warning of 
‘BANK ANGLE’ at 06:05:03 hours IST.

The aircraft crashed into a gorge, about 500 meters from the boundary fencing 
and the coordinates of the accident site were Latitude N 12º 56’ 47.64” and 
Longitude E 074º 52’ 25.2. Due to impact and fire, the aircraft was destroyed. In this 
tragic accident, 152 passengers and all 6 crewmembers lost their lives. There were  
8 survivors, out of which 7 passengers sustained serious injuries and one person 
escaped with minor bruises.

Although the crash site was outside the airport area, the crash and fire crew 
responded timely. Since the roads are narrow, the RFF Vehicles reached the crash 
site with difficulty. The response by the Civil Administration including Fire, Medical 
and Police Departments to this disaster was also fairly fast.  The local population 
rendered a lot of help for the rescue operations. Subsequently, Air India volunteers 
known as ‘Air India Angels’ provided yeomen service to the bereaved families and 
survivors in association with Civil Administration. 
 
The post-mortem and toxicology reports of both the Captain and the            
First Officer did not indicate consumption of any drugs, alcohol or medicines. 
 
At the behest of the Court, a team of experts from Bomb Detection and 
Disposal Squad (BDDS) O/o Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), Chennai was 
deputed on 13th June 2010 to examine the wreckage. As per their report dated 22nd 
June 2010, there was no evidence of any sabotage.

Right wing of the aircraft had impacted the ILS Localiser Antenna structure at 
the end of R/W 24 and sheared into pieces. Right Engine also broke off from the 
wing. The remaining portion of the aircraft fell in the gorge, broke into three parts and 
caught fire.  
 
The aircraft along with the contents was totally destroyed due to impact and 
post crash fire.   
 
1.4 
Other Damages 
 
As a result of the aircraft overshooting the runway, damage occurred to two 
Runway End Lights and five Elevated Approach Lights at the end of R/W 24. In 
addition, the mounting structure as well as some elements of ILS Localiser Antenna 
at the end of runway 24 and a part of the airport boundary fence, belonging to 
Airports Authority of India was also damaged. While falling into the gorge and before 
coming to a rest at the crash site, damage also occurred to some trees and 
vegetation.

Personnel Information 
 
 
1.5.1 
Pilot in Command - Captain Zlatko Glusica 
 
The Captain was a 55-year-old pilot who lived near Belgrade, Serbia.  He was 
employed as Pilot in Command (PIC) on Boeing 737-800 in Air India Express since 
15th December 2008, after having been issued the Foreign Aircrew Temporary 
Authorisation (FATA) by the DGCA. His last licensing medical examination, wherein 
he was declared medically fit Class 1 & 2, was held at Belgrade and was valid till   
16th Aug 2010.   
 
The PIC began his aviation career in JAT academy, in erstwhile Yugoslavia.  
After completion of his training, he joined the JAT airline and flew DC-9. Later, he 
had also flown Boeing 737-300 aircraft. After the breakup of Yugoslavia,              
Capt Glusica flew as PIC in different countries including Malta, Canada and Australia 
to name a few.  
 
Captain Glusica was remarried after divorcing his first wife.  He had children 
from both wives and was reportedly very fond of all his children. His son from the first 
wife was undergoing commercial flying training. As per some of his colleagues 
employed by Air India Express, Capt Glusica had shown no signs of stress with 
regard to the family or finances. They had stated that he was a well-built and 
physically fit person, a non-smoker and a teetotaller. During his entire period of 
employment with Air India Express, Capt Glusica had never been grounded on 
account of alcohol consumption.  
 
During interaction with other pilots, who had flown with Capt Glusica, he was 
reported to be a friendly person, ready to help the First Officers with professional 
information. Some of the First Officers had mentioned that Captain Glusica was 
assertive in his actions and tended to indicate that he was ‘ALWAYS RIGHT’. 
 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 9 | 175  
 
On 17th March 2010, Capt Glusica had been called to the Flight Safety 
Department of Air India Express regarding a ‘Hard Landing Incident’ on a flight 
operated by him from Muscat to Thiruvananthapuram on 12th December 2009. While 
the Chief of Flight Safety had stated that the counselling was carried out in an 
amicable and friendly manner, it was given to understand from his colleagues that 
Capt Glusica was upset about the counselling. As per the statements of some of the 
Serbian pilots, he felt that the counselling was not called for, since this was the very

under individual contracts. Capt Glusica, after having obtained a valid endorsement 
on Boeing 737-800 aircraft, was employed by Air India Express. The terms of 
contract of the Captain included 2 months (8 weeks) of flying duty in India and two 
weeks off to his hometown, near Belgrade, Serbia.  Captain Glusica had availed his

First Officer - H.S. Ahluwalia 
 
First Officer Harbinder Singh Ahluwalia was 40 years of age and belonged to 
Mumbai, India.  Air India Express employed him as a co-pilot on Boeing 737-800    
w.e.f. 27th April 2009.  His last licensing Class-I Medical Examination, wherein he 
was declared medically fit, was held at AFCME, New Delhi on 11th February 2010.  
This was valid for six months upto 10th August 2010.   
 
The First Officer began his aviation career from Gujarat Flying Club, Vadodara.  
He, thereafter, joined Jet Airways, where he flew as a co-pilot on Boeing 737-800 for 
almost five years.  
 
First Officer Ahluwalia belonged to a business family residing in Mumbai. He 
was unmarried and used to visit his widowed mother and other family members 
frequently. His colleagues and other captains who flew with him had informed the 
Court that First Officer Ahluwalia was professionally well informed. He had obtained 
his ATPL and was due for Command Training on Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  Having 
completed a total of about 3500 hours of flying and 3200 hours on type, First Officer 
Ahluwalia had queried the management on 27th October 2009 regarding his 
‘Command Up-gradation as per company requirement’.   
  
To this, the Chief of Operation had replied that the company policy for 
command conversion was based on: - 
 
 
 
Years of service on Company Aircraft.  
 
 
Hours on type on Company Aircraft (2000 hrs relaxed to 1500 hrs taking 
into account prior experience) 
 
 
Seniority in the Air India Express list and related stipulations.  
 
 
First Officer Ahluwalia was known to be meticulous in his adherence to 
procedures. He was also known to be a man of few words. He had complained in 
writing, his reservations about one of the foreign captains for not following the 
company SOP as well as correct CRM technique. The management had planned to 
counsel both, the concerned captain and First Officer Ahluwalia. However, the 
counselling had not taken place prior to the date of accident. In the interim, the 
scheduling staff had been verbally instructed, not to pair these two pilots together. 
 
The First Officer was stationed at Mangalore, where he was sharing an 
apartment with another co-pilot of Air India Express.

 17 | 175  
 
1.6.9 
Minimum Equipment List 
 
The aircraft had a DGCA approved Minimum Equipment List (MEL) which was 
prepared on the basis of Master MEL (MMEL) approved by the US Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). The MEL for the aircraft VT-AXV was invoked 3 times in March 
2010 and 6 times in the month of April 2010. On 25th April 2010, HF No 2 was found 
not tuning. Snag was isolated to Defective HF Coupler.  
 
The aircraft was released under MEL 23-11 in Cat C (Validity 10 days). It was 
revoked on 30th April 2010 after taking corrective action. This snag had not repeated 
till the date of the accident. The aircraft was released under MEL 25-26 under Cat D 
(Valid for 120 days) on 19th April 2010 with Passenger Seat 25 C unserviceable. It 
was revoked on 20th April 2010. However, again on 23rd April 2010, aircraft was 
released under MEL with Passenger Seat 25 C unserviceable, which was not 
revoked till the time of accident. Right Hand Logo Light was unserviceable and 
released under MEL 33-11 under Cat D, which was in effect at the time of accident.  
 
From the records, it was evident that Air India Express had been following 
correct procedure for MEL release and rectifying the defects within the stipulated 
period. However, it was noticed from the seat allocation chart that a passenger was 
allotted seat 25 C, which was released under MEL. It was also confirmed by the 
departure engineer that a message to this effect had been sent to Dubai. However, 
there was no confirmation from Dubai about receiving and taking suitable action in 
this regard. As IX-812 was not flying with full load, it is presumed that Cabin Crew, 
having knowledge regarding the un-serviceability of the seat from aircraft 
documents, might have re-seated the passenger to a serviceable seat. None of 
survivors was occupying seat 25C. 
 
1.6.10

1.6.13 
Aircraft Systems 
  
 
A brief description of the following aircraft systems is given below for a better 
understanding of this report. 
 
1.6.13.1 
Flight Control System 
 
The Primary Flight Control System, consisting of 2 Ailerons, 2 Elevators and    
a Rudder, moves the airplane about its three axes, Longitudinal, Lateral and Vertical. 
 
The Secondary Flight Controls consisting of 12 Leading Edge Devices,             
4 Trailing Edge Flaps, 12 Spoilers/Speedbrakes and Horizontal Stabiliser, make the 
lift and handling properties of the airplane better. 
 
 
 
Diagram 4: Flight Control Systems  
 
 
1.6.13.2 
Horizontal Stabiliser 
 
The Horizontal Stabiliser controls the pitch trim of the airplane about the lateral 
axis. The pilot manually controls position of the Horizontal Stabiliser with Stabiliser 
trim switches. Also, the pilot can use the Stabiliser trim wheels on each side of the 
control stand. When the autopilot engages, it controls the position of the Horizontal 
Stabiliser. During autopilot or manual electric operation, the actuator back drives the 
Stabiliser trim wheels. 
 
 
 
 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 22 | 175  
 
 
 
Diagram 5: Horizontal Stabiliser 
 
The Stabiliser trim wheels on the control pedestal move cables that give an 
input to the gearbox, which in turn moves a jack screw and moves the Stabiliser. 
 
The electric Stabiliser trim switches control an electric motor near the gearbox. 
The motor moves the gears to move the Stabiliser. The autopilot also controls the 
Stabiliser trim motor. When the Stabiliser moves, it also moves the elevators to 
streamline the elevators with the Stabiliser. 
 
1.6.13.3 
Trailing Edge Flaps 
 
The Trailing Edge (TE) flaps increase the wing area and the wing camber. This 
increases lift to help improve the takeoff and landing performance of the airplane. 
During cruise, the TE flaps fully retract. During landing, the TE flaps extend to 
increase lift and increase drag to permit slower speeds at touchdown. During the 
normal operation of the TE flaps, the TE flaps are mechanically controlled and 
hydraulically operated. During the alternate operation, the TE flaps are electrically 
controlled and electrically operated. The flap load relief function retracts the TE flaps 
at high airspeeds to prevent structural damage to the TE flaps and wing structures. 
The TE flap skew and asymmetry detection functions stop the TE flap hydraulic 
operation, if the TE flaps are not aligned. The TE flap Un-Commanded Motion (UCM) 
detection function stops the TE flap hydraulic operation, if the TE flaps move away 
from their commanded position. 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 23 | 175  
 
 
 
Diagram 6: Trailing Edge Flap System 
 
1.6.13.4 
Leading Edge Flaps and Slats 
 
The Leading Edge (LE) flaps and slats increase the wing area and the wing 
camber. This increases lift to help improve the takeoff and landing performance of 
the airplane. The LE devices include two Krueger flaps and four slats on the leading 
edge of each wing. During cruise, these surfaces fully retract. These surfaces extend 
during takeoff to increase lift, which permits slower speeds for airplane rotation. 
During landing, the LE slats fully extend to increase lift and help prevent a stall. 
 
During normal operation, the LE flaps and slats are mechanically controlled. 
During alternate operation, these are electrically controlled. The LE cruise 
depressurisation function depressurises the LE flap and slat actuators. This occurs 
when all the LE devices and the flap lever are at the up position and the airplane is in 
the air. The LE Un-Commanded Motion (UCM) detection function stops the LE 
normal operation if two or more LE flaps or slats move away from their commanded 
position. There is a position indication in the flight deck, for all the LE devices during 
normal operation and alternate operation. During the normal operation, if the airplane 
comes close to a stall condition, the auto slat function fully extends the LE slats. This 
helps to prevent a stall. 
  
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 24 | 175  
 
1.6.13.5 
Spoilers and Speedbrakes 
 
The spoilers help the ailerons control airplane roll about the longitudinal axis. 
They also supply speedbrake control to reduce lift and increase drag during landing 
and while aborting takeoff. There are six spoilers on each wing. The most outboard 
and the most inboard spoiler on each wing are ground spoilers and remaining are 
flight spoilers. During roll control, the flight spoilers on one wing move up and all the 
other spoilers stay down. The pilots manually control roll with the control wheels. 
When the autopilot is in ‘auto land’ mode, the autopilot commands the flight spoilers. 
 
 
 
Diagram 7: Speedbrake Control System 
 
During speedbrake control, the spoilers on both wings move symmetrically. The 
pilots manually command speedbrake control with a speedbrake lever on the aisle 
stand. The autopilot does not control the speedbrake function. 
 
The auto speedbrake function supplies automatic extension or retraction of all 
the spoilers during landing and rejected take-off. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 25 | 175  
 
1.6.13.6 
Brakes and wheels 
 
The hydraulic brake system controls hydraulic pressure to the main landing 
gear brakes. Brake hydraulic source selection uses the alternate brake selector 
valve and the accumulator isolation valve to control different pressure sources to 
supply pressure to these brake functions:- 
 
 
 
Normal brakes 
 
Alternate brakes 
 
Accumulator brakes. 
 
Gear Retract Brakes  
 
The brake pedals control the normal and the alternate brake systems. 
 
Normal Brakes 
 
If hydraulic system ‘B’ supplies pressure, the normal brake system uses 
hydraulic system ‘B’ pressure to operate the brakes. 
 
Alternate Brakes 
 
The alternate brake system uses hydraulic system ‘A’ pressure to operate the 
brakes when hydraulic system ‘B’ does not supply pressure. 
 
Accumulator Brakes 
 
When the hydraulic systems ‘A’ and ‘B’ do not supply the required pressure, the 
brake accumulator supplies the same, to the normal brake system.  
 
Gear Retract Brakes 
 
During landing gear retraction, the alternate brake system gets pressure to 
operate the brakes. This stops wheel rotation before the landing gear retracts. 
 
Brake Pedal Mechanism 
 
The brake pedal mechanism sends brake pedal inputs to the brake metering 
valves to manually control brake metered pressure. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 26 | 175  
 
Two sets of brake pedals operate the brake pedal bus mechanism. Pedal 
movement goes through vertical control rods to the lower bell cranks. These bell 
cranks connect to brake pedal bus crank assemblies and cable quadrants with fore-
aft control rods. Input to the left cable quadrant, controls the left brakes with brake 
cables on the left side of the airplane. The right cable quadrant and cables are on the 
right side of the airplane and operate the same as the left. 
 
Transverse control rods connect the left and right brake pedal bus crank 
assemblies. This permits control of the left and right brakes with the Captain or the 
First Officer pedals. 
 
 
Diagram 8: Gear Retract Brake System  
 
Auto brake System 
 
The auto brake system monitors wheel deceleration and controls metered 
pressure on touchdown to maintain the value selected by the pilot on the AUTO 
BRAKE select switch, until the airplane comes to a full stop. Following are the auto-
brake functions:- 
 
 
1, 2, 3, and MAX deceleration positions command the auto-brake system 
during landing brake control to modulate brake pressure until the airplane 
is at a full stop 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 27 | 175  
 
 
Rejected Take Off (RTO) position commands the auto-brake system to 
apply full pressure to the wheel brakes and stop the airplane. The auto-
brake system operates in RTO when the pilot starts a rejected takeoff at 
groundspeed more than 88 knots. 
 
 
 
Diagram 9: Auto Brake System  
 
1.6.13.7 
Engine Thrust Reverser System 
 
The Thrust Reverser (T/R) system changes the direction of the fan air exhaust 
to help decrease the speed of the airplane after landing or during RTO. 
 
The T/R system has two thrust reversers. T/R 1 is for Left Engine and T/R 2 is 
for the Right Engine. 
 
Each T/R has a left and right half. Each half has a translating sleeve, which 
moves aft for reverse thrust. The sleeves work at the same time, but are 
independent from each other. Three hydraulic actuators move each sleeve. Rotary 
flex shafts make sure that the hydraulic actuators extend and retract at the same 
rate. Each T/R has Linear Variable Driven Transducer (LVDT), which supplies 
translating sleeve position data to the Electronic Engine Control (EEC). 
 
The T/R control system uses hydraulic actuators to move the translating 
sleeves. The sleeves move aft during deploy operation. 
 
 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 28 | 175  
 
1.6.13.8 
Instrument Landing System 
 
The Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) contains the Instrument Landing System (ILS) 
and the Global Positioning System (GPS). The ILS provides lateral and vertical 
position data necessary to align the airplane on the runway for approach. The 
system uses signals from Glide Slope ground station and Localiser ground station. 
The Glide Slope ground station transmits signals to give the airplane a descent path 
to the touchdown point on the runway. The Localiser ground station transmits signals 
to give the airplane lateral guidance to the runway centre line. The receivers get 
manual tune inputs from the navigation (NAV) control panels. 
 
The VOR/LOC antenna and the localiser antenna send localiser signals 
through the localiser antenna switches to the MMR. The localiser antenna switches 
select the VOR/LOC antenna or the localiser antenna as the source of Radio 
Frequency (RF) input to the MMR. The glide slope antenna sends glide slope signals 
to MMR. 
 
1.6.13.9 
Radio Altimeter System 
 
The Radio Altimeter system has two Receiver/Transmitters (Rx/Tx). Each 
Rx/Tx has a receiver and a transmitter antenna. The radio altimeter Rx/Tx makes a 
frequency modulated continuous wave RF signal which is sent to the ground and 
reflected back to the airplane. The time that it takes for the signal to travel from the 
transmit circuit of the Rx/Tx to the receive circuit of the Rx/Tx is changed into 
absolute altitude. The number one system altitude shows on the Captain’s Display 
and the number two system shows on the First Officer’s display. The altitude data 
and signal validity is sent on two ARINC 429 data buses. 
 
The Rx/Tx get discrete inputs from the Proximity Switch Electronics Unit 
(PSEU) used to count flight legs for fault recording. 
 
1.6.13.10 Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System 
 
The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) alerts the flight 
crew of an unsafe condition when the airplane is near the terrain. It also supplies a 
warning for wind shear conditions. 
 
The EGPWS uses GPS and disk loadable software databases to give the flight 
crew improved terrain awareness. This is done by the display of detailed terrain 
information for the area around the aircraft. The EGPWS also warns the flight crew 
of an early descent. 
 
The EGPWS gives the pilots aural and visual warnings of unsafe conditions. 
The warnings continue until the pilots correct the condition. The system operates 
when the airplane is less than 2450 feet above the ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 29 | 175  
 
The EGPWS function contains a worldwide terrain database. The Ground 
Proximity Warning Computer (GPWC) compares airplane position and track with this 
database to find if there is a warning condition. This is the terrain awareness 
function. The EGPWS also contains an airport database. This database contains 
terrain information for all hard surface runways that are more than 3500 feet or 
longer. The GPWC compares airplane position and runway location to find if there is 
a warning condition. This is the Terrain Clearance Floor (TCF) function. 
 
EGPWS Modes 
 
Following are the modes of EGPWS:- 
 
 Mode 1 - Large descent rates  
 Mode 2 - Too much of a closure rate when approaching terrain that is rising 
 Mode 3 - Too much altitude loss during climb-out (at takeoff or in go around) 
when the airplane is not in the landing configuration 
 Mode 4 - Not enough terrain clearance 
 Mode 5 - Too much deviation below the glide slope 
 Mode 6 - Aural callouts when the airplane descends through selected radio 
altitudes 
 Mode 7 - Warning for wind shear conditions. 
 In addition to the EGPWS modes 1 through 7, following two additional 
functions are used:- 
 
i) Terrain Clearance Floor - early descent on approach 
ii) Terrain Awareness - display of terrain around the airplane. 
 
Mode 1 alert and warning conditions can occur between 2450 feet and 10 feet 
of radio altitude. The type of annunciation depends on the rate of descent and the 
radio altitude. The first annunciation is a caution. If the rate of descent does not 
decrease, the annunciation changes to a warning. The LRU that supply inputs for 
mode 1 operation are the radio altimeter trans-ceivers and the left and right Air Data 
Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU). 
 
The mode detector in the GPWC calculates the descent rate from the Inertial 
Vertical Speed (IVS) input. If it is not available, the mode detector uses an internally 
calculated altitude rate. If the IVS and the internally calculated rates are invalid, the 
barometric altitude rate from the ADIRU is used. When the GPWC uses barometric 
altitude rate, the lower altitude cut off changes from 10 feet to 30 feet. When there is 
a caution or warning condition, the mode detector sends a discrete signal to the 
speech prom to make the aural messages come on. The aural messages go to the 
Remote Electronics Unit (REU), which sends them to the flight compartment 
speakers. 
 
Mode 2 supplies alerts and warnings when the closure rate to the terrain is too 
large. Mode 2 has two sub modes, mode 2A and mode 2B. Mode 2A occurs for a 
large closure rate if the flaps are not in the landing configuration and glide slope 
deviation is more than 2 dots. Flaps 30 or more is a landing configuration. Mode 2A 
can have two alert levels, a caution condition or a warning condition. If the terrain 
closure is too large, the EGPWS gives the TERRAIN aural caution message twice 
and PULL UP shows on the Primary Flight Display (PFD).  
 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 30 | 175  
 
If the condition is not corrected, the caution aural message changes to the 
warning PULL UP message and PULL UP continues to show on the PFD. When the 
mode 2A envelope is no longer active due to either a terrain drop off or a pull up 
manoeuvre by the flight crew, the altitude gain function operates. PULL UP 
continues to show on the PFD until the altitude increases 300 feet or 45 seconds 
have elapsed. If there is still a terrain closure rate during this period, however, the 
EGPWS also gives the TERRAIN aural caution message. After a 300 feet increase 
in inertial altitude or when the landing gear comes down, the PULL UP indications on 
the PFD stop and the aural warnings also goes off.  
 
Mode 2B gives alerts for a large closure rate if the flaps are in the landing 
configuration (30 units or more). Mode 2B can have a caution condition or a warning 
condition. If the terrain closure is excessive, the GPWC gives the TERRAIN aural 
caution message repeatedly. If this condition lasts for more than 1.6 seconds, the 
GPWC gives the PULL UP aural warning message and a PULL UP annunciation on 
the PFD. 
 
 
1.6.13.11 Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) 
 
The voice recorder unit makes a continuous record of flight crew 
communication and flight compartment sounds. It erases the communication data 
automatically so that the memory stores only recent audio. 
 
The voice recorder unit keeps the last 120 minutes of communication data in 
memory. The voice recorder unit receives audio from the Remote Electronic Unit 
(REU) and the area microphone. The area microphone is in the cockpit voice 
recorder panel. The voice recorder unit receives time from the clock system for 
reference. 
 
The voice recorder unit collects the audio at the same time from the following:- 
 
 
Captain microphone and headphone 
 
First officer (F/O) microphone and headphone 
 
Observer (OBS) microphone and headphone 
 
Area microphone on the cockpit voice recorder panel 
 
The inputs from the captain, first officer, and observer microphones go to the 
REU. The REU mixes each station microphone audio with that station headphone 
audio. The REU then increases the audio signal and sends it to the voice recorder. 
The area microphone collects flight compartment sounds, such as voices and aural 
warnings.

 31 | 175  
 
1.6.13.12 Flight Data Recorder System (DFDRS)  
 
Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) stores airplane parameters and system data for a 
minimum of last 25 hours of operation. DFDR protects the parameters and the 
system data. If there is an airplane incident, these parameters supply data on flight 
conditions and airplane systems operation. Airline personnel can also use the data to 
make an analysis of system performance during airplane maintenance. 
 
The DFDRS gets and stores airplane parameters from airplane systems and 
sensors. The DFDR keeps this data for use during a flight mishap investigation. The 
DFDR protects the data from heat and water. The DFDR records parameters that 
are necessary for regulatory agencies. 
 
ACMS data from the Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU) goes through the data 
loader control panel to a data loader. The data loader can store data from the FDAU 
on a disk. The data loader control panel switch lets one select the transfer of ACMS 
data. One can transfer software from a disk in the data loader to the FDAU through 
the data loader control panel.  
 
The Control Display Unit (CDU) controls the ACMS functions in the FDAU. The 
DFDRS operates automatically when one of the engines is in operation or the 
airplane is in the air. It also operates on the ground when the TEST/NORMAL switch 
on the flight recorder test module is in the TEST position. The flight recorder test 
module shows the condition of the flight recorder system. If there is a system fault, 
amber OFF light comes on. The OFF light also comes on when the system switched 
OFF.

Meteorological Information 
 
The Mangalore Airport is situated on the western coast of India. It is thus 
subjected to active South West monsoon conditions, normally between              
June-September every year. In the month of May, generally pre-monsoon weather 
prevails with clouds and occasional thunder showers. The airport is situated on a 
tabletop plateau with surrounding undulating terrain and valleys. Therefore 
Mangalore also witnesses phenomena like mist and low clouds at the edge of the 
airfield. However, in periods other than the SW monsoon, the weather is generally 
fair to fine with good visibility.

State of Navigation and Landing Aids on 22nd May 2010 
 
The MSSR Radar was unserviceable from 20th May 2010 for which a NOTAM 
had been issued by AAI. The un-serviceability was due to shearing-off of the 
Antenna Rotary Joint. While the radar has built-in redundancy of an alternate rack to 
keep it serviceable, only first line spares are held at Mangalore to cater to minor 
technical breakdowns. Spare Antenna Rotary Joint had to be transported from Delhi 
resulting into delay of making the radar serviceable till 24th May 2010.  
 
Both ILS and VOR/DME were serviceable. The air calibration of ILS was last 
carried out on 14th May 2010 wherein Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) was 
found compatible with the Glide path. Regular ground maintenance calibration check 
of PAPI was last carried out on 18th May 2010 and no abnormality was found.   
 
There was no abnormality reported by crew of other flights regarding the 
Navigational aids. 
 
After the accident, the ILS was recalibrated on 16th Jun 2010 since the localiser 
antenna was damaged during the air crash.

Communication 
 
The aircraft remained in communication with Mangalore ATC till the crash, from 
the time it first came in contact with the Mangalore Area control on frequency   
127.55 MHz at 05:32:45 hours IST. The aircraft was then cruising at FL-370 
approaching Reporting Point IGAMA. Later on, it contacted the ATC Tower on VHF 
frequency 122.1 MHz.  
 
No communication problems were reported between the Flight Crew and the 
Air Traffic Control throughout, from its initial contact till the time of accident. From the 
ATC tape and CVR, it was apparent that the crew faced no difficulty during the flight, 
to contact ATC, Mangalore. 
 
1.10 
Mangalore Airport Information 
 
  Till 2006, Mangalore Airport had a tabletop runway 27/09 with a length of only 
1625 metres. This short runway restricted the type of aircraft operations. In view of 
incidents of overshooting the runway at Jaipur and Port Blair by Boeing 737-200 
aircraft, it was decided to extend the runways at both these airports and at 
Mangalore. A new runway with orientation of 24/06 was constructed in the available 
land adjacent to the existing runway. The length of new runway is 2450 metres, which 
facilitates operations by aircraft such as Boeing 737-800 and Airbus 320. The new 
runway 24/06 provides night landing facilities and an ILS Cat-I from the earlier offset 
ILS. The Rescue and Fire Fighting Services were upgraded to category 7.  
 
Mangalore Airport has Latitude 12º 57’ 43.40” N and Longitude 074º53’ 23.20” E 
with elevation of 101.629 metres above mean sea level. Runway 24/06 has a 
concrete surface with dimensions 2450 x 46 metres, elevation 103.07 metres and 
PCN 54/R/B/X/T. It is provided with runway strip of 75 metres of width on either side 
of runway centreline. At the time of accident, RESA of 90 metres x 90 metres was 
provided at the end of runway strip 24.  
 
1.10.1 
Licensing of Mangalore Airport 
 
Licensing of all Airports in India is governed by Civil Aviation Requirement 
(CAR), Section-4, Series-F, Part-I, dated 16th Oct 2006 issued by DGCA. On 
submission of required documents by AAI on 01st Nov 2006, the Mangalore airport 
was inspected by DGCA from 31st Jul to 03rd Aug 2007.  As per procedure, License 
No AL/Public/023 was issued by DGCA under Rule 78 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937 on 
16th December 2009 to AAI for a period of six months initially on provisional basis 
from 16th December 2009 to 15th June 2010. At the time of accident, Mangalore 
airport had a valid licence. Surveillance Inspection was also carried out by DGCA two 
days before the accident.  
 
While Action Taken Report enumerating the follow-up on a number of 
observations by the DGCA was completed, AAI had filed for extension of license on 
6th May 2010 seeking exemption on four points including the width of the Strip. In 
response, DGCA had directed AAI to submit Risk Assessment Analysis done by 
expert group so as to consider a permanent waiver.

Runway 24/06 Safety Areas 
  
The salient features of the Mangalore airport safety areas are as follows:- 
 
 
Runway Strip Length  
 
:  2570 metre 
 
Runway Strip Width 
 
 
:  75 metre as against 150 metre on                        
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   either side of runway centreline.  
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
   A permanent exemption has been  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   sought due to deep valleys on 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   either side of the runway strip. 
 
Length of Runway 24/06 
 
:  2450 metre 
 
Width of Runway 24/06 
 
:  46 metre 
 
Location of Threshold for R/W 24/06 :  Immediately at the beginning of R/W 
 
Runway End Safety Area (RESA) 
: 180mx90m at the time of accident

Runway Longitudinal Slope for R/W 24 is as under:- 
 
 
 
From 0 m to 565m 
 
 
:  
+ 0.46%  
 
From 564m to 1105m  
 
: 
-  0.56%  
 
From 1104 to 2450m  
 
: 
   0% 
 
At the time of accident, at the end of R/W 24 after the length of 2450 metres, 
there was 60 metres of Basic Strip followed by RESA of 180m (now reduced to 
175m).  After end of runway at 237m within RESA, a concrete structure had been 
constructed on which the ILS Localiser Antenna is mounted. This entire area is on a 
downward slope from the end of R/W 24. 
 
The non-frangible ILS mounting was not considered to be an obstacle since it 
was on a downward slope and not above the permissible height within the take-off or 
approach funnel.    
 
1.10.3 
Runway 24/06 Lighting Information 
 
The Mangalore airport is equipped with night landing facilities. Runway 24/06 
has been provided with truncated Simple Approach Lighting System on both sides.   
 
The Airport also has a standard PAPI fitment for both runways 24/06, set at       
3 degree and was calibrated on 14th May 2010 along with air calibration of ILS.  
 
1.10.4 
Runway 24 ILS System 
 
Runway 24 has been provided with ILS Cat-I. Its Glide Path is set at 3 degree. 
It was air calibrated just prior to the accident on 14th May 2010.  
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 37 | 175  
 
The ILS and DME equipment have built-in automatic monitoring system, which 
continuously monitors the performance of the equipment using redundant integral 
and near field monitors. In case of any deviations of operational parameters from the 
specified limits by ICAO, the monitors shut down the operating mode and transfer to 
the stand-by mode.  
 
1.10.5 
Location of Air Traffic Control Tower 
 
Prior to the construction of new Runway 24/06, a centrally located ATC Tower 
for Runway 27/09 existed. However, this location was found to be unsuitable for 
controlling flying and surface operations for the new Runway 24/06. Since, the earlier 
parking bays and old terminal building continued to be used, a semi permanent ATC 
Tower was built close to dumbbell 24. This temporary tower, however, has limited 
view of the end of Runway 24/06 and also of the new terminal building and parking 
bays, which has been made operational in the first week of August 2010, after the 
accident. 
 
1.10.6 
Facilities in the ATC Tower 
 
The ATC Tower is fitted with standard communication facilities with remote 
controls for runway lightings, including PAPI. The Tower does not have an Approach 
Radar and is also not fitted with a Repeater of the Area Radar (MSSR).  
 
This temporarily constructed ATC Tower has constraints of space. As such, the 
Meteorological officer finds it difficult to get a 360 degree view for reporting visibility, 
as well as any local weather phenomena.   
 
As per AAI, considering the low density of air traffic at Mangalore, provision of 
Approach Radar is not considered cost effective. The controllers at Mangalore 
however, did express such a need especially in view of the surrounding terrain, 
which adds to the criticality of this airfield. Provision of at least a repeater of the Area 
Radar (MSSR) in the ATC Tower would add to the situational awareness of the 
controllers.  
 
1.10.7 
ATC Watch Hours 
 
The Mangalore Area Control works on 24 hours basis with controllers working 
on shift duties. While this Area Control is provided with a Radar (MSSR), in case of 
un-serviceability, it continues to provide procedural control on 24 hour basis. The 
night shift consists of 8 controllers with one of them designated as Watch 
Supervisory Officer (WSO).  
 
The watch hours for Mangalore ATC Tower were from 06:00 hours to         
22:00 hours at the time of accident. The Rescue and Fire Fighting (RFF) Crew 
reported at 05:30 hours to be ready for operations from the designated watch hours 
at 06:00 hours. 
 
Two controllers, who are part of the night shift, are detailed to man the ATC 
Tower. As per the procedure, one of these controllers goes for runway inspection 
leaving the Area Control at about 05:40 hours. Meanwhile, an ATC Traffic Hand 
opens the ATC Tower. On completion of runway inspection, the ATC controller 
reaches the Tower about 5-7 minutes before the official watch hours i.e. 06:00 hours.  
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Mangalore airport starts the morning watch hours from 06:00 hours mainly to 
cater to the scheduled arrival of Air India Express flight IX-812. The flight is 
scheduled to arrive at 06:30 hours daily. However, invariably the flight arrives just 
past 06:00 hours due to either early departure from Dubai or due to tail winds during 
flight. Since the Area Control is aware of this movement, sending two controllers 
from the night shift to give ‘landing clearance’ becomes very convenient. However, 
such procedure does not cater to an unscheduled movement such as diversion to 
Mangalore in emergency.  
 
1.10.8 
Manning of ATC Controllers and Training 
 
At the time of accident, Mangalore airport had a total of 29 ATC controllers who 
worked in three shifts every day. Depending on their training and categorisation, the 
controllers were assigned duties on the Area Control and the ATC Tower. One 
senior controller amongst the shift was assigned the duties of Watch Supervisor 
Officer (WSO). Normally, there were eight controllers in each shift; two of them 
manned the ATC Tower. As per laid down procedure, periodic training was being 
carried out for all the controllers locally.   
 
1.10.9 
ATC Tape Recorder 
 
The ATC Tape Recorder system being used at Mangalore airport is a        
Digital Voice Tape Recorder (DVTR). It has facilities to programme and record 
various R/T Channels as well as Telephone and intercom conversation along with 
time of recording.  The basic details of DVTR are given below:-

Runway Markings and Friction 
 
At the time of accident, the runway marking for R/W 24/06 at Mangalore 
conformed to CAR, Section-4, Series-B, Part-I dated 31.07.2006 issued by DGCA 
and ICAO Annexure - 14.  
 
The condition of runway surface at the time of accident was dry and not 
contaminated. There were no significant rubber deposits in the touchdown zone. 
However, the accident aircraft had finally touched down at about 5200 ft from the 
beginning of R/W 24, which corresponds to touchdown zone of R/W 06. This area, 
where the accident aircraft had touched down, was also devoid of reverted rubber 
deposits.  
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 39 | 175  
 
Considering the number of flight movements, the policy requires testing of 
friction values once a year. The previous friction test using Airport Surface Friction 
Tester (ASFT) vehicle was carried out on 27th December 2008. As per these test 
results, the friction values were 0.64 mµ to 0.66 mµ. However, similar test was not 
carried out prior to the accident, for the preceding one and half years. 
 
The runway friction values had been evaluated soon after the accident; on       
5th June 2010 in accordance with DARA Circular No. 6 of 2006 of AAI and ASFT 
Mark IV SAAB 9000 equipment was deployed using both the smooth and ribbed 
tyres. The values obtained were in the range of 0.78 mµ to 0.91 mµ, which were 
much higher than the minimum required 0.40 mµ. 
 
1.10.11 
Rescue and Fire Fighting (RFF) Capability at Mangalore Airport 
 
At the time of accident, Mangalore airport maintained Rescue and Fire Fighting 
Capability at level - 7 as laid down in CAR, Section-4, Series-B, and Part-I, dated    
31st July 2006. There were a total of 6 RFF vehicles, 4 of which were Rosenbauer,         
re- christened as Panther 1 to 4 and 2 TATRA vehicles known as Agni Shatru and 
Agni Vijay. There were 3 ambulances as part of the team.  
 
The 4 Rosenbauer were procured centrally by AAI. These new RFF vehicles are 
heavy, but have a good capability of Rescue and Fire Fighting within the airfield. 
Considering the surrounding terrain of the Table Top runway at Mangalore, no terrain 
specific tests were conducted prior to their allotment to Mangalore Airport.  As such, 
when these RFF vehicles were taken outside the airport, difficulty was experienced 
while negotiating the narrow and curving roads. These vehicles had not been 
registered with Regional Transport Authority at the time of accident. The RFF 
manpower was 31 and was well trained.  
 
It was given to understand that the responsibility of Rescue and Fire Fighting 
operations outside the Mangalore Airport area lies with the civil administration. 
However, within 5 km of the airport especially in view of an accident on overshoot or 
undershoot area, the RFF for the airport needed to be deployed at the earliest to 
carry out RFF operations.   
 
As per the Airport Director, Mangalore, yearly exercises involving civil 
administration had been carried out for an aircraft emergency within the airfield. 
However, a full-scale simulation for outside the perimeter had not been carried out. 
Only a Table Top exercise had been carried out to assign responsibilities and for 
preparing an emergency telephone list of various authorities.   
 
 
Full emergency exercise was carried out in December 2007 inside the airport. 
Partial mock up exercise was carried out on 19th April 2010. The last fire drill was 
carried out on 7th May 2010 and the last Airport Environmental Management 
Committee meeting was held on 17th February 2010. 
 
1.10.12 
Rescue and Fire Fighting Carried Out On 22nd May 2010  
 
After the accident, ‘Panther 1’ reached the localiser area in about 30 seconds. 
Thereafter, it extinguished the aircraft parts, which were on fire, and lying close to the 
airport fence. However, the aircraft had gone down the slope and came to a halt in 
the gorge about 500 metres from the fence.

As per the discussion at Mangalore airport as well as with AAI, the jurisdiction 
of Mangalore RFF was to attend to contingencies within the airport. However, on the 
day of accident, Mangalore Airport RFF was the first to reach the crash site. Since the 
Rosenbaur RFF vehicle was unable to negotiate the narrow roads, TATRA RFF 
reached the sites within 4-5 minutes.  
 
 
 
Photo 3: Rescue and Fire Fighting at the Crash Site 
 
Although they reached as quickly as possible, the aircraft had already suffered 
major impact and a dense fire and smoke had engulfed the aircraft. Most of the other 
RFF crew, who were off duty and at residences near by, also rushed to the crash site 
with all available RFF vehicles and ambulances. With great motivation and 
involvement, the fire was partly brought under control by the AAI staff in the next    
30-40 minutes by which time the Civil Fire Tenders had also joined fire fighting at the 
crash site. The entire fire could only be brought under control in about 2 hours. 
 
Cutting trees to approach the crash site took some time, which hindered the 
rescue operations. Other than 8 survivors who had jumped out of the aircraft, the 
crew and passengers had already died due to impact injuries, suffocation and fire, by 
the time the RFF personnel could reach the occupants.  
 
1.11 
Flight Recorders 
 
The aircraft was fitted with solid state CVR and DFDR. The CVR in damaged 
condition was retrieved from the accident site on 23rd May 2010. The Memory Unit of 
DFDR was found in damaged condition and was retrieved on 25th May 2010.  
 
While Air India has facilities for decoding the Flight Recorders, it was not 
possible to do so, since the recorders were damaged during the accident. The Flight 
Recorders had suffered severe damage and the outer casings had been burnt due to 
excessive heat during the aircraft crash and the post impact fire. The Court therefore 
took the recorders to the NTSB, USA where they were successfully repaired and 
decoded so that these could be once again read at the laboratory of                  
DGCA, New Delhi.

Wreckage and Impact Information   
 
1.12.1 
General Wreckage Distribution 
 
Aircraft was cleared for the ILS approach Runway 24. As per the Fire personnel 
positioned at the Pre Determined Point (PDP) (Coordinates: 12˚ 57.376’ N;            
74˚ 53.366’ E; 777 metres. from the beginning of R/W 24; height of the vehicle 
including surface elevation: 12 metres), the height of the approaching aircraft was 
above the height of the fire vehicle.  Tyre marks for about 22 metres were observed 
in the area where aircraft had finally touched down, approximately 5200 ft from 
beginning of R/W 24, way ahead of the normal touchdown zone. The aircraft had 
veered off towards left of the centreline as shown below:-

Thereafter, aircraft broke two runway edge lights towards the left of landing run 
(1st and third on left of centre line viewing from R/W 24). Then the aircraft overran 
the R/W 24 end and entered the Runway End Safety Area (RESA). It further broke 
five approach lights for R/W 06, in the RESA. In the RESA, wheel marks of all the 
three landing gears indicated that the aircraft was gradually turning towards the left. 
This is indicated in a rough Diagram 10, placed above.

At a distance of 235 metres from R/W 24 end, the ILS localiser antenna had 
been mounted on a concrete structure. The out board portion of the right wing 
impacted this localiser mounting structure and got separated. The Right wing 
contacted two left pillars and the extreme left pillar collapsed. The second pillar from 
left, showed impact damage about 10 feet above ground. Outer portion of the right 
wing (WBL 616.75 to WBL 680.40) consisting of winglets was recovered at the 
localiser structure.

The aircraft then impacted the boundary fence and a portion of the Right wing 
(from WBL 71.24 to WBL 616.75) containing T/E Flap number 8, L/E Flaps and 
Slats, was found lying at the edge of the boundary.  There were indications of fire 
visible in this area on the vegetation where the portion of the wing was found. 
Mangalore being a tabletop runway, the aircraft moved down along the slope of the 
hill after impacting the boundary fence. A portion of the Right wing, Right engine, 
Right main landing gear and few other structural parts separated from the aircraft in 
this area.  Due to impact, component/parts of the Right engine also separated. Right 
engine fan frame, thrust reverser frame, core engine and associated components 
were recovered on the slope.

At the end of the initial down-slope, there was a road followed by a gorge. The 
aircraft entered the gorge and separated into three main portions. The aircraft caught 
fire and a large portion of the aircraft was consumed in the fire. Due to impact and 
fire, the aircraft was destroyed.

Cockpit Switches and Gauges 
 
The cockpit portion (STA 130 to STA 259.5; part of Section 41) had separated 
from the fuselage. The Nose gear was attached to the cockpit portion. The EE 
compartment/Lower Lobe of the fuselage below WL 208.1; STA 259.5 to STA 360 
was damaged. Due to impact, the nose compartment had shattered.  The avionics 
and electrical components, radar and FDIU were found in their usual location. Few of 
the units were damaged/stripped open, while a majority of the units were recovered 
in undamaged condition. The instruments and the display units were also found in 
their usual location, but in damaged condition.  
 
After the initial rescue and recovery actions, position of switches and CB’s in 
the cockpit were as follows: - 
 
 
‘CAP’S PNL LTG’ and ‘CTR PNL LTG’ CB’s were observed to be popped 
out. All Other CB’s were either damaged or in ‘IN’ position. 


Medical and Pathological Information  
 
A total of 128 bodies including the co-pilot were brought to Wenlock hospital for 
post mortem examination and the remaining bodies were sent to other hospitals. All  
8 survivors were passengers and were treated in different hospitals.  
 
1.13.1 
Post-mortem report of PIC Captain Glusica 
 
The Captain’s autopsy was conducted in Father Muller Medical College, 
Mangalore, on 22 May 2010 between 3.00 pm to 4.30 pm.  The body was identified 
by his passport size photographs and printed pieces of paper found on his person.   
It is evident that the Captain had died of deceleration injuries sustained on impact. 
The coronaries were found to be normal and patent.  No abnormal odour was noted 
in the stomach contents. The cause of death was written as ‘due to multiple injuries 
sustained in the aircraft accident consistent with the history provided.’ The viscera 
and blood samples were preserved to assess blood alcohol levels and carbon 
monoxide and sent to Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL), Mangalore.   
 
1.13.2 
 
Post-Mortem Report of First Officer HS Ahluwalia 
 
The First Officer’s autopsy was conducted at the Dept of Forensic Medicine, 
Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore on 23rd May 2010.  The body was identified by 
the presence of a yellow coloured chain and locket as well as by evidence of a 
surgery, which was confirmed by his relatives.  Major deceleration injuries were 
noted. Samples of the stomach and its contents as well as parts of other relevant 
organs were forwarded to RFSL, Mangalore.   
 
1.14 
Fire 
 
1.14.1 
Fire in the Air 
 
There was no evidence of in-flight fire. The eyewitness also confirmed that no 
fire was seen before the impact.   
 
1.14.2 
Post Impact Fire 
 
A large portion of aircraft was found burnt / melted / fused due to the fire.  The 
examination of the wreckage revealed that the fire was post impact.  The first sign of 
fire damage was seen on the vegetation, at the edge of the airport boundary, where 
aircraft wing impacted the localiser structure.  
 
1.14.3 
Emergency Response 
 
Emergency Rescue and Fire Fighting response by the RFF Crew of Mangalore 
Airport was swift. One of the RFF Panther-1 was at the PDP close to the runway and 
had witnessed the aircraft touching down late. As soon as the aircraft had entered 
RESA causing the dust to rise, this RFF had rushed behind the aircraft. However, 
after initial impact with the ILS localiser mounting structure, the aircraft had 
continued to plough down into the gorge outside the airfield perimeter.  
 
 
the portion of the right wing was recovered. Apparently, the fire had started after the 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 50 | 175  
 
This RFF reached to the edge of the slope close to airfield perimeter and tried 
to throw water and foam towards the aircraft. But, the crash site was out of its range. 
It, therefore, extinguished fire of all parts of the right wing, which had broken off after 
the impact with ILS structure.

Meanwhile, second RFF TATRA reached the accident site from the crash gate, 
after following the narrow winding roads downhill. Although, it reached within about 4 
minutes of the accident, the ensuing fire and smoke precluded rescue operations. 
The crew also had to cut trees and vegetation and take help from RFF hoses to go 
down to the aircraft for access to the passengers and crew. However, the intense fire 
and smoke had already taken the toll with only 8 passengers jumping out of broken 
portions of the aircraft.  
 
The Mangalore airport RFF crew residing nearby also rushed to the crash site 
with all possible RFF vehicles and ambulances. In about 30 minutes, the civil fire 
tenders had also joined the combined operation of trying to recover charred remains 
of the crew and passengers. The dedication and involvement of all personnel of 
Mangalore airport, civil administration and the civil population was praiseworthy. 
 
1.15 
Survival Aspects 
 
The injuries to the occupants were mainly due to aircraft impacting the gorge 
and subsequent fire. Most of the passengers had received fatal injuries. A large 
number of fatalities were due to burns. Several passengers had died due to 
decelerated injuries and burns. Of the eight survivors, seven passengers had 
received serious injuries and one passenger had received minor injury.

The Captain’s body was found on the LH seat and co-pilot’s body was lying 
near the cockpit.  The body of one of the cabin crew was found in burnt condition 
near the cockpit door. The pilot and co-pilot’s seats were found in burnt condition. 
 
1.15.1 
General Description 
 
All survivors were fully awake and alert during landing and prior to the crash.  
They had noticed smoke and fire inside the passenger compartment, which seemed 
to be coming more from the front section. All survivors had un-harnessed themselves 
and moved out of their seats to make good their escape from a break in the fuselage 
from where they could see daylight. This break had provided them with natural light 
to facilitate their escape. From the description of the survivors it also appeared that 
the fuselage had broken at a point just behind the wings and they had either jumped 
out or were pushed by others through this opening created by the broken fuselage. 
Soon after their escape, while some of them were still in the vicinity of the wreckage, 
the plane had caught fire.  Some of the survivors had sustained burn injuries on their 
hands and face, while escaping from the aircraft.   
 
1.15.2 
Evacuation of Passengers and the Crew Members 
 
As mentioned in earlier paragraph, the impact and resultant fire had already 
taken the toll of all crew members and passengers other than 8 who had escaped on 
their own. Although the fire personnel made quick and gallant effort, the rapid spread 
of fire and impact forces had resulted in fatalities to 6 crew members and              
152 passengers. Due to tilting of the aircraft during the crash, it would have difficult 
for the passengers to operate emergency exit. As such, the survivors had escaped 
through a break in the fuselage and not by opening any emergency exit. 
 
1.15.3 
Survivors 
 
There were a total of 8 survivors who had occupied seats as shown in the 
Layout of Passenger Accommodation (LOPA). These survivors had occupied the 
seat No 7A, 17C, 19A, 19C, 20C, 21C, 23D & 23F. It could be seen that there was 
no specific pattern of seating, which helped in survival. All the eight survivors were 
occupying seats in different rows and not necessarily along the window or aisle. Of 
these, most were grouped from seat rows 17 to 23 and only one was ahead at 7A. 
However, it was to their good fortune that the aircraft broke into 3 main portions 
which allowed them to jump out of the openings mainly to the left since the aircraft 
had tilted to the right when it finally came to rest. 
 
The survivors were also interviewed by the Court regarding other passengers 
and crew members. The survivors had stated that some of the other passengers had 
also tried to unfasten their seat belts in an attempt to escape, but seemed unable to 
move due to rapid spread of fire. One of the survivors even remembered pushing a 
lady passenger while jumping out of the aircraft. This was later corroborated by the 
lone lady survivor from the accident aircraft.

Assistance to Injured and Family Members 
 
Apart from the personnel of Mangalore airport who had responded very swiftly 
to the accident, the disaster management by civil administration was also timely. The 
civil fire tenders had reached within 30 minutes as also the police and medical 
personnel. There was also spontaneous outpouring of assistance from the civil 
population.  
 
Air India had also reacted swiftly with their Emergency Response procedure. 
An onsite office for assistance to the survivors and bereaved family members was 
set up at Mangalore airport and in town. An organisation within Air India made up of 
volunteers known as ‘Air India Angels’ did praiseworthy job of providing help to the 
injured and to the family members of those who had lost their lives in the accident. 
Later ‘single window’ assistance was provided by Air India and the District 
Administration together, to provide initial grants as well as death certificates. All the 
survivors and bereaved families had praised the assistance provided by Air India 
Angels.

Examination and Testing of Components 
 
A total of 63 components were removed from the wreckage site to the Overhaul 
Division of Air India Mumbai for detailed examination.  On some of the components 
essential testing was carried out at various laboratories under the supervision of team 
members associated with the Inspector of Accident and the Court of Inquiry.

Flap handle was found in the 40 detent. Trailing Edge Flap Jack Screws were 
found in the fully extended position, which corresponded to the fully extended 
position of the flap. From DFDR data, it was seen that flap lever and the flap surface 
were in 40 degree position in flight from 06:03:23 to 06:04:16 hours IST. Thereafter, 
while the flap lever continued to remain in the 40 detent, the surface had retracted to 
30 degree between 06:04:17 and 06:04:37 hours IST due to increase in speed of the 
airplane. Flap surface was again extended to 40 degrees from 06:04:38 hours IST till 
the time of the accident. From the above, it could be implied that Flap system had 
responded correctly to the commands.

The dimension ‘B’ as given in the Diagram No 5 was measured from the debris. 
It was found to be 37 inches. This corresponds to 6 units of Stabiliser Trim. For 
airplane full nose ‘UP’ position, the dimension ‘B’ should be 21.32 inches and for full 
nose ‘DOWN’ condition, the dimension should be 45.84 inches. From this 
observation, it could be inferred that the horizontal Stabiliser was in nose ‘DOWN’ 
position, which is the landing configuration.

Summary of Engine Inspection 
 
From the examination of the engines, it was evident that Left Engine was found 
in the low power position and Right Engine was found in the high power position. As 
per the observations made on the debris, both Thrust levers were at the forward 
position which indicated demand for high power. At the time of impact with the ILS 
Localiser Structure, Right Engine along with the Right wing had separated from the 
aircraft and engine had disintegrated at high power.  
 
In the case of Left Engine, it was reported by the survivors that engine was still 
rotating when they escaped from the aircraft. It appears that engine had continued to 
run and possibly wound down due to fuel starvation. This could explain engine being 
found in the low power position on examination. 
 
As per recordings on the DFDR at 06:04:42 hours IST just before touchdown, 
Thrust levers were at 26 degrees and corresponding N2 on Left Engine was 76.8% 
and N2 on Right Engine was 78.1%. EGT of Left Engine was 499 degrees and that 
of Right Engine was 517 degrees. Fuel flow recorded was 523 kg/hour on Left 
Engine and 603 kg/hour on Right Engine.  
 
Thrust Reversers were in transit at 06:04:43 hours IST and were fully deployed 
by 06:04:44 hours IST. Thrust Reversers remained deployed for 10 seconds from 
06:04:44 to 06:04:54 hours IST. Maximum power developed during this period was 
N1 76.8% on both engines, N2 was 93% on Left Engine and 91.9 on Right Engine 
respectively. Corresponding EGT and Fuel flow increase was also recorded. Thrust 
Reversers were in transit again from 06:04:54 to 06:04:57 hours IST and were fully 
stowed by 06:04:58 hours IST.  
 
At 06:04:55 hours IST, both Thrust Levers were pushed forward to 84 degrees, 
which corresponded to full forward power position. Both engines had responded 
immediately and by 06:04:58 hours IST, N2 had increased to 83.4% and 87.5% on 
Left Engine and Right Engine respectively. Maximum N1 recorded was 77.55% and 
87.5% on Left Engine and Right Engines respectively. 
 
From the above, it could be concluded that both engines responded to the 
Forward and Reverse Thrust commands, and developed power as intended. 
Captain, after landing used full reverser for 10 seconds and then opened power on 
both engines to full power till the time of the accident. 
 
During deposition by GM, CFM Engine Shop, Air India, Mumbai at the Public 
Hearing, these reports were submitted. On query by the Court, he had mentioned 
that there was no evidence of any bird ingestion in either of these engines.

As per the DFDR, in flight residual brake pressure of 227 PSI on the left and 
180 PSI on the right brakes was recorded. At 06:04:42 hours IST on touchdown, 
Auto Brake activation was indicated with rise in brake pressure to 301 PSI on the left 
and 244 PSI on the right brakes. At 06:04:49 hours IST, Auto Brake was disengaged 
and increase in brake pressure to 1196 PSI on the left and 887 PSI on the right was 
recorded, which indicated manual brake application. Maximum brake pressure of 
3075 PSI and 2425 PSI was recorded on the left and right brakes, respectively, at 
06:04:52 hours IST. At 06:04:54 hours IST, brakes were released indicating drop in 
brake pressure to 339 PSI on the left and 342 PSI on the right. This also 
corresponds to the Thrust Reversers moving from Deployed Position to the Stowed 
Position.  
 
From the above, it could be seen that all the four brakes were functional and 
the brake system had provided Auto and manual braking as per the inputs. However, 
at 06:04:55 hours IST, when both Thrust Levers were pushed to the full power 
position, there was an indication of progressive increase in brake pressure to full 
brake application on both left and right brakes. This could be explained by 
inadvertent or intentional application of the brakes by the fight crew, who had 
possibly noticed the ILS localiser mounting structure, appearing in front.

Organisational and Management Information 
 
1.17.1 
Brief History of Air India Express 
 
Air India Charters Limited (AICL), Mumbai operates a low cost airline under 
name ‘Air India Express’ and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India. The DGCA 
had issued the Air Transport Operating Permit (AOP) No S-14, in Passenger/Cargo 
Category, on 22nd April 2005. The permit was re-validated on 22.4.2008 up to 
21.4.2013. The airline commenced its operations on 29th April 2005 with 26 flights per 
week, using 3 leased Boeing 737-800 aircraft. At the time of accident, the airline had 
a total of 25 (22+3) Boeing 737-800 aircraft in their fleet, indicating a rapid growth 
within 5 years. The AI Express aims to provide low competitive fares to connect 
Indian cities directly to destinations in the Gulf, South and South East (SE) Asia.  
 
At the time of accident AICL operated about 204 flights every week and 
connected 27 cities across South and SE Asia as well as the Middle East. It operated 
from multiple bases, and was using 8 bases namely Kozhikode, Kochi, Chennai, 
Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Delhi, Mangalore and Dubai. The average aircraft 
utilisation for May 2010 was 09:15 hours per day. 
 
1.17.2 
Organisational Structure 
 
Since Air India Express is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, it was 
convenient to depute Post Holders from the parent company for initial setting up of 
operations. However, even with 25 aircraft on its strength and widespread operations, 
this arrangement of deputing the management from parent company had been 
continued. The Post Holders of Chief of Operations, Training and Flight Safety 
continued to be Senior Pilots of Air India, who flew Boeing 777 or Boeing 747 to 
maintain their currency. None of these Post Holders were qualified on Boeing        
737-800 aircraft, operated by Air India Express.  
 
The Chief of Flight Safety of Air India Express reported to the Chief of Flight 
Safety, Air India, who in turn reported to the Chairman. Similarly, the Chief of Training 
was also from Air India and it was only after the accident that one of the senior 
captains from Air India Express qualified on Boeing 737-800 had been appointed as 
Chief of Training. 
 
For a legacy carrier like Air India, low cost operations are a totally different 
philosophy. Unlike Air India, which operates on long haul international sectors, Air 
India Express operates on short haul international sectors from multiple bases and 
many of these are Quick Turn Around (QTA) flights.  
 
It was evident from above that although Air India Express had a separate AOP, 
it did not function as a separate entity. During interaction with Post Holders, the 
demarcation of responsibility between Air India and Air India Express was not clearly 
evident. The organisation chart of Air India Express at the time of accident is shown 
on the next page:-

Flight Operations 
 
1.17.3.1 
Command Conversion 
 
Air India used to initially train their pilots on Airbus A-310 aircraft after which the 
pilots used to graduate to wide body aircraft such as Boeing 747 and Boeing 777. 
With a dwindling fleet of A-310 aircraft, Air India had started sending Pilots to Air India 
Express for Command Conversion Training on Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Once 
qualified, the newly trained Captains would revert to Air India on wide body aircraft. 
Such an arrangement continuously added training load on Air India Express. This was 
also a bone of contention for the contractual Air India Express Pilots who were 
awaiting their turn to qualify as Captains. The senior management would use ad-hoc 
formula for relative seniority in progressing the two sets of Pilots for Captaincy. With 
lack of communication and transparency, such decisions became an irritant for the 
contractual Pilots. This was also evident from the query raised by late First Officer 
Ahluwalia, who wanted to know as to how long he would need to wait for Command 
conversion even after obtaining ATPL.

 70 | 175  
 
1.17.3.2 
Tenure of Deputation  
 
The Post Holders of Air India Express who were deputed from Air India had 
occupied the office for different periods of tenure. This arrangement was not 
conducive to efficient management since it takes some time to understand the 
functions of a low cost carrier operating from multiple bases.  After the accident, 
however, the Chairman had given instructions for the deputation to be for a minimum 
period of 5 years. Similarly, the flight crew, which were sent to Air India Express for 
command conversion on Boeing 737- 800, used to revert to Air India shortly before 
their Command Conversation on Air India aircraft. This again was not a conducive or 
good practice since the contractual personnel of Air India Express felt that it was 
functioning more as a training airline and that too, feeding Captains into a more 
lucrative job profile of the parent company, Air India. Also such practice gave an 
impression of a mindset that it was only a stop-gap arrangement for Air India Pilots to 
be on deputation to Air India Express.  
 
1.17.3.3 
SOP and Flight Manuals 
 
Air India Express had flight crew comprising of those on contract and also on 
deputation from Air India. In addition, a number of foreign pilots had been contracted 
due to shortage of Captains. In a hybrid composition such as this, it was important to 
adhere to a common SOP. 
 
Till the time of the accident, the SOP though prevalent, had not received 
approvals of the DGCA. Since flight crew were from different backgrounds, they might 
have carried habits from the previous operator. It was, therefore, important that all 
crew followed standard and approved SOP of Air India Express. This would have 
enhanced the Situational Awareness and Communication Skills of the pilots to 
maintain a safer envelop of operations and better safety standards.    
 
1.17.3.4 
Multi Base Operations 
 
Air India Express operates flights mainly to the Middle East as well as South and 
South East Asia. Since Air India Express is designed to be a low cost airline, it is 
operating from 8 different bases to cater to the passenger traffic from those areas. As 
such, some of the aircraft are based at these airfields. Similarly, as much as possible, 
the flight crew are also stationed at these places.  
 
While such multi-base operation is a good commercial model, it also adds to 
some constraints on the functioning of Air India Express. In view of such operations, 
the aircraft need to be rotated for major maintenance, which is carried out at Mumbai. 
Since the company has not yet ensured computerisation and networking, the flow of 
information is not smooth. The analysis of CVR as part of FOQA is also being carried 
out partially by downloading the CVR only at Mumbai and not from other bases. 
 
Due to multi-base operations, important information like Flight Operations 
Bulletin (FOB) and other documents are circulated to the Flight Crew Members 
without ensuring that these have been received and read by them.

 71 | 175  
 
1.17.3.5 
Coordination Meetings 
 
It is important that the operations department holds periodic coordination 
meetings, which is a pivot for effective and efficient operations. Such meetings are 
not only mandated by DGCA, but also help in better understanding as well as synergy 
of operations with training, flight safety, maintenance, to name a few. This is 
particularly important in multi base operations with flight crews of diverse 
backgrounds. However, it was noticed during investigation that hardly any minuted 
co-ordination meetings including those of Flight Safety Committee were held by the 
Post Holders.  
 
1.17.3.6 
ILS Approach Procedure 
 
The flight crew who deposed in the Court narrated the standard ILS Approach 
procedure of intercepting the ILS Localiser initially and thereafter, intercepting the 
Glide Path at the correct altitude. While this procedure is the most desired, the flight 
crew of accident aircraft did not follow the same. There was no documented 
procedure with Air India Express for intercepting the Glide Path from above before the 
accident. However, after the accident, Boeing had incorporated a procedure of 
intercepting the Glide Path from above so as to meet the criteria for a Stabilised 
Approach.  
 
1.17.3.7 
Stabilised Approach 
 
As per standard procedure, all aircraft must be stabilised on approach by      
1000 feet altitude in IFR and 500 feet altitude during VFR. If the desired approach 
conditions are not met before these heights, the aircraft must go around and make 
another approach for landing. All the flight crew who interacted with the Court also 
confirmed that similar procedure was being followed by Air India Express. In addition, 
in case of unstabilised conditions, if the First Officer gave a call to this effect, the 
Captain invariably performed a ‘go around’. However, contrary to the SOP, during this 
accident, the Captain had persisted with landing from an unstabilised approach. 
 
1.17.3.8 
Go Around Procedure 
 
The Air India Express SOP on ‘Go Around’ on final approach conforms to the 
procedure to be followed when an aircraft is on an unstabilised approach. It is 
expected that after two calls on intercom to this effect, the First Officer performs a   
‘Go Around’.  
 
Some of the pilots, who deposed in the Court had stated that a ‘Go Around’ had 
to be followed up by an Operational Incident Report (OIR). Many pilots felt that such 
reporting also added pressure on them while flying. Undoubtedly being a commercial 
venture, an operator would want to know the reasons for ‘Go Around’. However, the 
same can be discerned while carrying out FOQA analysis and if there is a trend of 
consistent unstabilised approaches by a particular pilot, he could be duly counselled. 
In response, it was mentioned by the Post Holders of AI Express that the OIR were 
being raised since the DGCA wanted to collect data on ‘Go Around’.   
 
 
 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 72 | 175  
 
It was also given to understand by one of the foreign pilots that when he had to 
‘Go Around’ at one of the airports, the ATC controller had asked for the Captain’s 
particulars and also the reason for going around. Such R/T call on an open channel 
was not only embarrassing for this pilot, but after landing, he was asked questions by 
the media. This can also lead to additional stress and pressure on a pilot who at that 
moment would have taken the correct action of ‘Going Around’ instead of continuing 
with the approach and landing, which could well have resulted in an accident/ 
incident. 
 
1.17.4 
Employment of Foreign Pilots: Captain Z Glusica 
 
Air India Express employs foreign pilots from different agencies around the 
world. Due to shortage of qualified Captains, the main thrust is on employing the 
PIC. These foreign pilots are governed by individual contracts such as 8 weeks duty 
followed by 2 weeks leave in their own country. Such frequent movement in and out 
of country creates difficulty for crew scheduling. It was informed to the Court that the 
foreign pilots fly about 75% of the total hours in a year as compared to their Indian 
counter parts.  
 
Captain Glusica was employed by Air India Express through a Serbian Agency 
since 15th December 2008. His contract included 14 days off every 2 months of flight 
duty in India. He had availed his off days and had returned from home town on 18th 
May 2010. While he had operated from Mangalore in November 2009, the QTA flight 
on 21st / 22nd May 2010 was his very first flight after return from leave.  
 
The Court wanted to obtain detailed background of Captain Glusica to dwell 
into the aspects such as Flight Safety track record, weaknesses in Training, if any, 
Medical History etc. However, it was noticed that such details were not available with 
the operator and the same was also not mandated by the Regulator i.e. DGCA for 
issuance of FATA. It may be pertinent to mention that after about 3 months the Court 
could access some of these details. It was also intimated to the Court that possibly 
due to uncertainty regarding the renewal of FATA, Captain Glusica was in search of 
employment with other international carriers such as Turkish Airlines. After the crash, 
the RFF Crew had found Turkish currency in his shirt pocket. 
 
1.17.5 
Flight Crew Training 
 
With a rapid growth in last 5 years, the requirement of training within Air India 
Express had also increased considerably. It was reported that the strength of pilots 
had increased from 30 to 242 in 5 years. In addition, 105 Captains and 115 First 
Officers are under training. Apart from training and retraining its own flight crew on 
contract and those deputed from Air India for Command Conversion had also added 
to the training task.  
 
The foreign pilots also needed to be given adequate training to make them fully 
conversant with Indian conditions of weather, Radar coverage, RT phraseology 
especially in view of different accents and aerodrome procedures etc. With multi base 
operations, the training requirement had to be programmed as per crew scheduling.  
A number of senior staff from both Management and Flight Crew had mentioned the 
aspect of programming as a major constraint. Undoubtedly, training had remained 
disjointed and somewhat a weak area. This was evident from the performance of both 
flight crews of the accident aircraft in terms of non-adherence to SOP as well as faulty 
planning of descent profile.

1.17.5.1 
Simulator Training 
 
Air India Express has a simulator for Boeing 737-800 aircraft at its premises in 
Mumbai, which was installed on 28th February 2007. Depending on the training 
requirement, the flight crew are scheduled for simulator training. However, this 
simulator suffers from maintenance problems and frequent breakdowns. The 
average serviceability of the simulator was about 17 hours per day and average 
utilisation rate was about 14 hours per day during the last one year. As such, on 
many occasions, simulator of other agencies was used for training. Since there is a 
vast requirement of training, the simulator should have much better logistics support 
and serviceability.  
 
1.17.5.2 
Availability of SFI and TRE/TRI 
 
At the time of accident, there were a total of 5 SFI, 4 TRE and 7 TRI for training 
of 242 pilots including both, Captains and First Officers. With such vast requirement 
of training and retraining, there was a proportional need for additional SFI and TRI.   
To ensure that the flight crew of varied backgrounds function cohesively, there was a 
need for more effective training and testing. To be able to do this, Air India Express 
needs to have more TRE. A number of Post Holders as well as other senior pilots had 
brought out this requirement during their deposition. 
 
1.17.5.3 
Training on CRM 
 
The senior management personnel of Air India Express, who deposed in the 
Court, had indicated that Crew Resource Management (CRM) training was covered 
during initial training and in various simulated LOFT exercises. GM-Training had also 
mentioned that although more recurrent training on CRM was desirable, the 
scheduling constraints had precluded such a requirement. 
 
Considering the diverse backgrounds of flight crew, it is important that the 
quantum of training on CRM be increased. Such CRM training needs to be validated 
during training flights and simulator to address the issue of crews with different 
backgrounds and cultures performing as a cohesive team.  
 
1.17.5.4 
Trans-Cockpit Authority Gradient 
 
In this accident, the First Officer had been able to identify the unstabilised 
approach conditions, but a steep gradient had apparently precluded him from taking 
over the controls or to enforce any corrective actions.  
 
1.17.5.5 
Training Infrastructure 
 
Air India Express does not have its own infrastructure for conducting training 
and has to share the facilities of Air India. In view of large requirement of training such 
an arrangement does add to the constraints.   
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

1.17.6 
Flight Safety Organisation and Supervision  
 
1.17.6.1 
 FOQA and CVR Analysis in Multi-Base Operations 
 
During the investigation, it was observed by the Court that Air India Express 
was carrying out CVR analysis as mandated by the CAR, Section-5, Series F, Part-I, 
Revision 2, dated 17th March, 2009 only for flights operating to Mumbai.  This did not 
give correct analysis since the airline operates from many other bases. It was also 
noticed that the equipment being used for monitoring the CVR did not give the 
desired quality of voice recognition. 
 
In view of multiple base operations, it took about 3 weeks for Air India Express 
to monitor 100% FOQA analysis of DFDR. This duration should be cut down for 
faster monitoring of various parameters by networking and computerisation. 
 
1.17.6.2 
 Policy regarding Hard Landing 
 
The Flight Safety Department of Air India Express had set a limit of 1.65 Vg as a 
Company filter to counsel flight crew for what is considered to be a ‘Hard Landing’ 
during touchdown. While the manufacturer has the AMM figure of 2.1 Vg to be 
correlated with other parameters, it was mentioned to the Court that one of the DGCA 
officials had given verbal instructions to report ‘Hard Landing’ in case the Vg was 1.8 
or more.  
 
Setting such lower limit of Vg as compared to the CMM had resulted into Flight 
Safety counselling of pilots, as was the case with late Captain Glusica. The flight 
crew, who deposed in the Court, expressed their apprehension at being called to the 
Flight Safety Department for counselling, as it could well mean a blot on their career. 
A number of pilots had expressed such anxiety and possibility of stress while 
executing a landing to conform to these limits. 
 
1.17.6.3 
Flight Safety Counselling 
 
It is a common industry practice to call the flight crew for counselling in case of 
a serious violation of safety standards. However, each operator adopts different 
techniques to counsel the flight crew, with a purpose of correcting any wrong 
practice especially, if it is noticed to be a trend with such a pilot. Further, personal 
interaction allows an erring pilot to explain the circumstances, so that the incident 
can be analysed more comprehensively. It also allows the supervisors to address 
shortcomings, if any, in the training being imparted.  
 
The pilots of Air India Express, on the other hand, are averse to being called by 
the Flight Safety Department since it is considered that any adverse remarks would 
jeopardise their career progression. The pilots consider it somewhat demeaning and 
further stressful, if such counselling is indicated on Crew Schedules and is open 
information to other pilots. 
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 75 | 175  
 
The underlying purpose of counselling is to guide the erring pilot so that he 
does not commit such mistake again. The intention is not to be intimidating or 
threatening, as it would then defeat the very purpose of such personal interaction. 
Although, none of the pilots specifically mentioned of having been subjected to a 
harsh counselling by any of the supervisors of the Flight Safety Department of Air 
India Express, the Court had received a number of informal inputs to this effect. 
 
It is pertinent to note that unless an isolated incident so warrants a personal 
counselling, it is desirable to do so in case of a persistent trend. The counselling can 
also be done by personal e-mail. If it needs to be done in person, discretion should 
be maintained so that a pilot does not feel embarrassed. To reiterate, the personal 
interaction should be for corrective action and not to intimidate a pilot. In the case of 
late Captain Glusica, he was counselled for a one-off incidence and that too for 
exceeding the landing ‘Vg’ limit, which was below the limit set by the manufacturer. 
As per the supervisors, the counselling was carried out as per the verbal instructions 
of landing ‘Vg’ limits set by the Regional representative of the DGCA. 
 
1.17.6.4 
Counselling to Late Captain Glusica 
  
  
On 17th March 2010, Capt Glusica had been called to the Flight Safety 
Department of Air India Express regarding a ‘Hard Landing Incident’ on a flight 
operated by him from Muscat to Thiruvananthapuram on 12th December 2009. While 
the Chief of Flight Safety had stated that the counselling was carried out in an 
amicable and friendly manner, it was given to understand from his colleagues that 
Capt Glusica was upset about the counselling. As per the statements of some of the 
Serbian pilots, he had felt that the counselling was not called for since this was the 
very first such incident and not a trend. Also, it was the First Officer who had carried 
out the landing and that the ‘Vg’ limit recorded was only 1.9 Vg as against the 
manufacturer’s limit of 2.1 Vg. 
 
None of the Pilots who deposed in the Court could give specific instances of 
any harsh or intimidating counselling. However, the Court had gleaned that most of 
the Pilots had not taken counselling in a positive manner possibly leading to 
apprehension and stress. Since counselling is an important function and an art which 
not everyone can be good at, Air India Express Flight Safety Department needs to 
carry out such counselling in a discreet or a friendly manner or else, it could be 
counterproductive.  
 
1.17.6.5 
Training in Flight Safety Functions for Supervisors    
 
It was noticed by the Court that none of the senior supervisors responsible for 
flight safety had undergone any formal training in this specialised area. There was a 
need for not only the supervisors of the flight safety department but also those from 
operations, training and engineering to go through training capsules on flight safety 
so that all activities are focused towards safe operations. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 76 | 175  
 
1.17.6.6 
Implementation of Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) 
 
Since a number of flights flown by AI Express are QTA flights with extended 
hours of flights at night and in the period of WOCL, the flight crew should be trained 
to manage fatigue arising out of flying at odd hours. They would need to adjust 
themselves to take rest according to the flight schedules. As such, Air India Express 
needs to train the flight crew on Fatigue Risk Management System. 
 
1.17.6.7 
Air India Flight Safety Journal ‘Safe Wings’ 
 
Air India used to publish a flight safety Journal ‘Safe Wings’ to spread Flight 
Safety awareness among the pilots and engineers of the organisation. During 
deposition in Public Hearing, it was mentioned by ED-Flight Safety that this journal 
had been discontinued since July 2008.  Such journals are useful in bringing out 
various recommendations of earlier incidents/accidents and also make the flight crew 
aware of new initiatives in enhancing flight safety. 
   
1.17.7 
Computerisation for Efficient Functioning 
 
1.17.7.1 
Scheduling of Pilots 
 
Air India Express does not use computerised programming for Crew 
Scheduling. Instead, it is carried out using pencil, paper and eraser. This is in 
contravention to the CAR, Section - 3, Series - C, Part - I, revised in 2009 issued by 
DGCA, which prescribes use of computers. This aspect had also been brought out 
by the DGCA audit. Although the entries are inked the next day, such practice leaves 
a room for frequent changes leading to lack of transparency.  
 
A number of flight crew had also mentioned that they were not aware of a    
long-term schedule (one week is the normal industry practice) to plan their own 
personal activities. As per them, this aspect not only added stress, but also had 
implications on the requisite rest periods when the flight schedule was changed at 
last minute. Since crew scheduling has implications on flight safety, it is desirable to 
implement computerisation of crew scheduling at the earliest.  
 
1.17.7.2 
Scheduling of Cabin Crew 
 
During interaction with the Cabin Crew of Air India Express, it was also brought 
out that there were frequent changes to their schedules. In addition, during the 
course of investigation, it was learnt that a number of cabin crew had completed their 
annual flight duty hours and hence, they could not be utilised for the remaining 
period.  This had even led to cancellation of few flights. Such shortcoming in 
scheduling of Cabin Crew can be overcome by the use of computerisation and 
networking. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 77 | 175  
 
1.17.7.3 
Multi Base Operations 
 
Since AI Express operates from multiple bases, all aspects of Operations, 
Engineering and Commercial can be well co-ordinated with use of Computers. This 
was evident from allotment by the Commercial staff of an unserviceable Seat No 
25C, which was carried forward under MEL to a passenger travelling from Dubai on 
IX-812 on 22nd May 2010. 
 
1.17.7.4 
Ease of Communication with Flight Crew 
 
Use of Computers will also allow an efficient and faster means of 
communications with the flight crew operating from multiple bases. Changes to 
operating instructions or any flight safety alerts can also be made known to them at 
the earliest. 
 
1.17.8 
Working Environment  
 
During interaction with Post Holders and other senior Pilots of AI Express, it was 
evident that the senior management lacked cohesion. The Court was made privy to a 
number of e-mails indicating a strained relationship not conducive for efficient and 
safe operations. Since the Post Holders were from the parent company Air India, 
friction was visible between the contractual senior pilots of Air India Express with 
these Post Holders. 
 
There were hardly any coordination meetings between all the Post Holders to 
synergise the working environment. This needs to be addressed on priority as it has 
implications on flight safety.   
  
1.18 
Additional Information 
 
1.18.1 
Use of Mobile Phones and Personnel Electronic Devices 
 
For the purpose of aircraft industry, Portable Electronic Devices (PED) can be 
divided into two categories. One category of PED are those which intentionally 
transmits radio signals like mobile/cellular phones, amateur radio transceivers and 
transmitters that control devices such as toys, etc. Others are those, which are not 
intentional transmitters of radio signals like laptop computers, video cameras, 
calculators, electric shavers etc. However, some of the later category of PED can 
also have additional features and may fall into intentional transmitters of radio 
signals category. 
 
 The frequency bands of the electronic equipment of aircraft are different than 
that of the PED. There are chances, though very remote, that the electromagnetic 
emissions from PED may interfere with the airborne equipments. Therefore, the use 
of PED, which intentionally transmit radio signals like mobile/cellular phones, 
amateur radio transceivers on board the aircraft, is prohibited.  
 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 78 | 175  
 
In the year 2008, a research was carried in USA on the use of PED on aircraft. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requested Radio Technical Commission/ 
Committee for Aeronautics (RTCA) to present an up-to-date evaluation of the use of 
PED on board civil aircraft with emphasis on intentional transmitters such as devices 
enabled with cellular technologies, wireless RF network devices. RTCA submitted 
the report in December 2008, and in its report, it has stated ‘At this point, there is not 
sufficient information to support a universal change in existing policies regarding the 
use of transmitting PED on board aircraft.’ The existing policies of use of PED 
aboard US registered aircraft are defined in FAA Advisory Circular 91-21.1B.             
 
DGCA vide its Rule 29 B of Aircraft Rules, 1937 also prohibits the operation of 
PED aboard Indian registered civil aircraft. This rule permits the use of specified 
PED and other devices that in the opinion of the operator do not cause interference 
with the navigation of or communication systems of that aircraft. The conditions for 
use of PED are specified in CAR Section 5, series X, Part I. Electronic devices, 
intentionally transmitting radio signals like mobile/cellular phones, amateur radio 
transceivers etc if carried on board, shall be kept switched off in all phases of flight. 
Electronic devices which are not intentional transmitter of radio signals such as 
laptop computers, electronic entertainment devices shall not be used by any person 
inside the aircraft during take-off, climb, descent, final approach and landing phases 
of flight. All operators shall by suitable means address passengers on board their 
aircraft, to this effect. 
 
The Indian operators including Air India Express have a procedure for 
announcements by cabin crew about switching off the mobile phones and other 
electronic devices before takeoff and landing phase of a flight. As per statements 
made by the survivors, cabin crew had made such announcements prior to landing 
of the ill-fated flight. 
 
1.18.2 
Table Top Airport at Mangalore 
  
The Mangalore Airport is at Latitude 12º 57’ 43.40” N and Longitude                
074 º53’ 23.20” E with elevation of 101.629m above mean sea level. The Airport 
presently has two runways 24/06 in operation since 2006 and the old runway 27/09. 
Runway 24/06 is predominately being used for airline operation and is also fitted with 
ILS Cat-1. While the length of the runway 24/06 is adequate for operations by aircraft 
such as Airbus A320 and Boeing 737-800, the downward slope at end of R/W 24 
leading into hill slope is not recommended if one is to consider the hazards of 
overshooting the paved surface during takeoff or landing. There is a concrete 
structure at the end of R/W 24, which cannot be classified as obstruction as per ICAO 
Annexure-14, since it is below the approach and take off funnel.  
 
There are three tabletop airports in India from where scheduled flights operate. 
These are Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui. Because of the undulating terrain and 
constraints of space, these airfields require extra skill and caution while carrying out 
flight operations. The hazard of undershooting and overshooting, in particular, can 
lead to grave situations, as was the case in this accident.  
 
These table top runways also have a problem of access roads around the 
airfield, which may need to be used in case of aircraft accidents. The narrow and 
winding roads can delay and hinder the rescue operations. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 79 | 175  
 
1.18.3 
Critical Airfields 
 
DGCA has classified certain airfields as critical which need special qualification 
for the flight crew to undertake operations. The criteria for classifying airfields as 
critical are based on various factors such as terrain, length of runway, predominance 
of inclement weather etc. There are 11 such airfields, which include the Table Top 
runways of Mangalore, Kozhikode and Lengpui. In addition airfields such as Patna, 
Jammu, Leh, Port Blair etc also qualify as ‘critical airfields’. 
 
The operators can add some more airfields as critical, in case additional caution 
needs to be exercised during operations. As per SOP of Air India Express, three 
airfields at Mangalore, Kozhikode and Pune qualify as ‘critical airfields’. These 
airfields are, therefore, cleared for operations by experienced flight crew and take off 
and landings have to be carried out by PIC only.  
 
1.18.4 
Distance to Go Markers (DTGM) 
 
As a visual reference to ascertain the remaining distance, it is recommended to 
install DTGM on runway shoulders. A number of pilots mentioned to the Court that 
such visual aids were helpful during take-offs and landings. The pilots also mentioned 
that Mangalore being a Table Top Runway installation of DTGM would be an 
additional help.  
 
Since a number of civil air operators also use IAF airfields, use of DTGM could 
help the pilots to ascertain critical distances such as TODA, ASDA etc. if such 
runways do not have standard ICAO markings.  DTGM are made out of frangible 
material and are installed at not only all Indian Air Force airfields, but also at a 
number of civil airfields abroad. 
 
In this connection, DGCA had also issued a circular No AV. 20021/1/82-AR II 
(P) dated 9th October 1985. It was an advisory for providing Fixed Distance Markers 
along the runways.  
 
1.18.5 
Pilot Fatigue: FDTL Regulation 28 of 1992 
 
The Flight and Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) for Air India Express was being 
governed by Para 4 of AIC 28 of 1992 issued by DGCA, which is applicable to 
International operations.  
 
On the other hand, Para 3 of above regulation deals with operations within the 
country and neighbouring countries, without specifying the names of neighbouring 
countries or in terms of change in Time Zones. In 1992, when this regulation came 
into force, there were only 2 commercial operators. Air India would fly long haul 
sectors and Indian Airlines would undertake flights domestically and to the 
neighbouring countries. In view of rapid growth in civil aviation sector and 
introduction of typical operators like Air India Express, as well as other related issues 
regarding fatigue, WOCL, rest periods etc., a revision of AIC 28 of 1992 has already 
been mandated by the Bombay High Court. A committee under the chairmanship of 
DGCA had submitted the revised FDTL Regulation to the Ministry of Civil Aviation 
during September 2010. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

1.18.6 
Controlled Rest in Seat 
 
The Court was informed by a number of senior pilots who operate two-man 
cockpits such as Boeing 737-800 that they do feel like taking a short nap (micro 
sleep or power nap) during the cruise phase of flying. Most of them have admitted of 
having either availed such a nap themselves or seen other crewmembers dozing off 
for a while. There are dangers of such a nap prolonging into a deep sleep causing 
effects of sleep inertia.  There is also a possibility of induced sleep, which affects the 
other crew members, who may also doze off. 
 
There have been many incidents of such nature worldwide. The DGCA had 
also investigated a case of 2 flight crews allegedly sleeping at the same time and 
over flying the destination during 2009. The DGCA had issued Air Safety Circular   
No 2 of 2009 dated 12th January 2009 by which the ‘cabin crew is required to interact 
with pilots on intercom every 30 minutes’. Although such a procedure is useful, it is 
possible that only one of the pilots who is awake all the time, would reply and the 
other crew could go into deep sleep. This was evident from the CVR, wherein 
Captain Glusica had slept for a considerable period with First Officer Ahluwalia 
responding not only to the R/T, but also to queries by the Cabin Crew.  
 
A number of pilots of Air India Express had mentioned to the Court that after 
operating QTA flights at night, the pilots generally feel fatigued and wish to complete 
the flight as soon as possible.   
 
Many airlines such as Air Canada have, therefore, brought out SOP accepting 
the fact that flight crew do take a nap which may actually refresh them prior to 
descent and landing. DGCA, therefore, needs to take a comprehensive view into the 
aspect of Controlled Rest in Seat, especially in a two-man cockpit.  After due 
analysis, a regulation needs to be brought out for its effective implementation. 
 
1.18.7 
Submission by the Participants to the Court 
 
The Court had invited a number of participants to suggest improvements in 
Flight Safety. Other than Air India Express, DGCA and AAI, various associations of 
pilots, engineers and ATC Guild had also actively participated in these deliberations. 
Their suggestions regarding flight safety counselling, FDTL, Duty Hours etc. were 
noted. 
 
In view of rapid growth in civil aviation sector, apart from focus on additional 
infrastructure, there is also a need to pay attention on human resource issues such as 
training, scheduling and fatigue factors etc. The ATC and Engineering personnel 
brought out the need for DGCA Regulation on Duty Time Limitations to cater to 
fatigue.  
 
1.18.8 
Brief on Airports Authority of India 
 
Airports Authority of India (AAI) was constituted by an Act of Parliament and 
came into being on 1st April 1995 by merging erstwhile National Airports Authority 
and International Airports Authority of India. The merger brought into existence a 
single organization entrusted with the responsibility of developing, upgrading, 
maintaining and managing civil aviation infrastructure as well as management of air 
space. Details regarding AAI can be browsed on http://www.aai.aero. 
Factual Information                                                                   Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Apart from airport management, AAI ensures training of Air Traffic Controllers 
and Rescue and Fire Fighting Crew. AAI also carries out central procurement of 
various CNS and ATM equipment as well as RFF vehicles.  
 
1.18.9 
Brief on DGCA 
 
1.18.9.1 
Organization and personnel 
 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is an attached office under the 
administrative control of Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India. DGCA 
promulgates the regulations under the Aircraft Act, 1934 and the Aircraft Rules, 
1937. Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) are issued under Section 5A of the Aircraft 
Act, 1934 and these are also kept updated from time to time in line with Standard 
and Recommended Practices; and associated procedures contained in the ICAO 
Annexes.   
 
The Director General heads DGCA. There are 14 Regional / Sub-regional 
offices spread throughout the country. The duties, functions and responsibilities of 
DGCA are defined and these can be browsed at DGCA website www.dgca.nic.in.  
DGCA formulates rules and regulations, issues registration to aircraft, licences to 
pilots, AME, ATC controllers and aerodromes. It also grants approvals to operators 
and maintenance organisations, issues certificate of airworthiness and their renewal.  
 
1.18.9.2 
Safety oversight capability 
 
DGCA conducts audits, surveillances and carries out Spot / Surprise Checks to 
ensure effective implementation of safety related rules, regulations and 
requirements. Regional and Sub-Regional Offices of DGCA carry out surveillance 
checks as per the Standard Check List formulated area wise. These Check Lists are 
available on DGCA website for information. DGCA brings out a Quarterly News 
Letter ‘Nai Udan’ in which Flight Safety issues are briefly mentioned.  
 
DGCA is also mandated to ensure that all the foreign airlines operating in India 
adhere to safe operating environment as outlined by ICAO. During investigation, it 
was brought out that DGCA was in the process of bringing out necessary regulation 
in this regard. 
 
During the investigation, it was also brought out that DGCA had directed all the 
operators to incorporate Safety Management System (SMS) to enhance the level of 
safety. Such comprehensive measures in all spheres of aviation activity can be 
implemented with requisite vigour, only when the senior management is also 
exposed to training in Flight Safety. 
 
1.18.9.3 
Audit of Air India Express 
 
 DGCA had carried out an audit of Air India Express during November 2007.   
A number of observations were made during this audit. After the accident, DGCA 
carried out another audit during June 2010. A number of observations were repeated 
in this audit e.g. Post Holders not being qualified on type, non-computerisation of 
Crew Scheduling etc. DGCA had also directed Air India Express to operate as an 
Independent Entity in view of their separate AOP.

1.18.10 
Setting up of Indian Aviation Safety Board 
 
In the last decade, there has been a rapid growth in the Indian Civil Aviation 
sector. With further growth projected in this vital means of transportation, there is a 
need for an independent body, which will function as a watchdog in the matters of 
flight safety. The role of this independent body would be not only to investigate 
accidents and incidents of serious nature in Indian Aviation, but also to draw upon 
the recommendations emerging from accidents and incidents, worldwide. Since this 
organisation will be focusing mainly on flight safety related issues, it will help in 
formulating proactive strategies to reduce accidents and incidents. 
 
Such independent safety organisations have been set up in various countries 
such as National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of USA, Air Accidents 
Investigation Branch (AAIB) of UK, Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada, 
Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses (BEA) of France and National Transportation 
Safety Committee (NTSC) of Indonesia, to name a few. It is pertinent to mention that 
a similar organisation known as National Transportation Safety Board, India had 
been set up in 1987 on the lines of NTSB, USA. However, it did not have the 
independence as a statutory body and therefore, it did not fructify into a permanent 
set up.  
 
In view of increase in volume of air traffic, a proposal to this effect has already 
been taken up by the DGCA and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

2. 
Analysis 
 
2.1 
General 
 
The analysis has been carried out to arrive at ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘why’ the 
accident took place. While the aspects of piloting have been analysed, some of the 
other factors have also been dwelt upon to either rule out their relevance or to 
establish their bearing on the accident. Some of the factors considered include Air 
India Express organisational issues including flight safety counselling, safety areas 
at Mangalore Airport, fatigue and aero medical issues as well as interference by 
PED, to name a few.  
 
2.2 
Sequence of Events 
 
2.2.1 
Pre-departure Check by AME  
 
As per the Oman Air personnel at Dubai, to whom the maintenance had been 
outsourced, the aircraft had arrived in a serviceable state from Mangalore for the 
QTA flight. The Flight Crew had also not reported any unserviceability. The Oman Air 
maintenance staff had carried out refuelling as per the instructions of Flight Crew. 
The aircraft had then been released after the turn around servicing, along with          
2 defects carried forward under MEL from the previous flight. These 2 defects were 
of minor nature, one on passenger seat 25C and the other on Right Hand Tail Logo 
Light. 
 
2.2.2 
Pre-Flight Check by Pilot 
 
Statements of the Ground Handlers, Commercial Staff and Maintenance 
personnel at Dubai had confirmed that the pilots had performed all their Pre-Flight 
Checks in a normal manner.  
 
2.2.3 
Take Off  
 
From the analysis of the DFDR, it is evident that the take-off was un-eventful. 
 
2.2.4 
Climb 
 
From the analysis of the DFDR, it is evident that climb was un-eventful. 
 
2.2.5 
Cruise 
 
Analysis of DFDR and CVR revealed that the aircraft did not fly through any 
noticeable turbulence and followed the prescribed route from Dubai to Mangalore. 
Recording available on the CVR was for the last 2 hours and 5 minutes. During 
cruise, there was no intra-cockpit communication between the Captain and First 
Officer for the initial 1 hour 40 minutes.  However, there was occasional 
communication between cabin crew and the First Officer.   
 
On the CVR, there was a definite evidence of Capt Glusica having slept in his 
seat during the cruise. Captain’s heavy breathing and snoring was recorded 
intermittently on the Captain’s microphone channel of the CVR, while the First Officer

had made all the required R/T calls. The Captain’s breathing pattern indicated that 
he was sleeping and it was recorded from the 11th minute of available 2 hours and 5 
minutes of the CVR recording. This was recorded intermittently until 21 minutes 
before the accident. 
 
It was also evident from the CVR recording that there was no interaction 
between the Captain and the First Officer regarding position reporting or weather 
monitoring.  Mangalore Area Control gave them instructions to carry out VOR DME 
Arc approach for runway 24. This vital information was received only by the First 
Officer and communicated by him to the Captain much later.  This was in 
contravention of Air India Express SOP. This also indicated total breakdown of 
proper crew coordination and CRM. 
 
The First Officer was continuously monitoring and communicating on R/T. At 
05:37:16 hours IST, the First Officer requested if they were identified on radar. First 
Officer was advised by the ATC that the radar was not available. The information of 
radar not being available was also published in the NOTAM issued since 20th May 
2010.  
  
 At 05:41:50 hours IST, the First Officer briefed the Captain regarding the 
weather and gave a short briefing on the expected approach at Mangalore. This was 
the first time that the CVR recording had revealed limited communication between 
the flight crew. However, the Captain did not communicate effectively in response to 
this briefing.  The approach briefing was incomplete and not in conformity with 
stipulated procedures mentioned in the SOP. 
 
2.2.6 
Descent 
  
At about 130 miles from Mangalore, the aircraft requested for descent 
clearance. This was, however, denied by the Mangalore Area Controller, who was 
using standard procedural control, to ensure safe separation with other air traffic.   
As instructed by Mangalore Area Control, the aircraft had reported its position at 
05:46:53 hours IST, when it was 80 DME on radial 287 MML. The aircraft was 
cleared to 7000 ft and commenced descent at 77 DME from Mangalore at 05:47:28 
hours IST. The visibility was reported to be 6 km. 
 
At 05:50:46 hours IST, the First Officer had reported passing through FL 295.  
Soon after, at 05:50:54 hours IST and 50 DME MML the Captain had deployed 
speedbrakes to increase the Rate of Descent (ROD). At 05:51:57 hours IST, the 
Captain and the First Officer performed the Descent Preparation as per FCOM 
during the descent, but this was much later than the stipulated procedures.  
 
As per the Air India Express B737-800 SOP, Descent Preparation should start 
at approximately 150 nm and should be completed before the aircraft descends 
below the cruising altitude for landing.  It includes weather review, approach briefing 
and delegation of duties to be performed by the Captain and First Officer. This was 
especially incorporated to enhance situational awareness throughout the descent, 
approach and landing.  
 
The delegation of duties helps in proper communication, understanding and 
reduces the workload on the flight crew. The purpose of the pre-descent briefing is to 
ensure that both crew members have a clear understanding of the proposed  plan of 
action and are in complete agreement as to how this plan will be executed.  
 
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
85| 175 
As per Air India Express SOP, use of headsets is mandated from start of pre-
flight check list up to top of climb and from top of descent up to completion of secure 
check list after landing.  However, the CVR transcript indicates that the first 
communication by the Captain using Hot mike started, only at 05:52:08 IST, which 
was about 13 minutes before the crash. 
 
The salient features of the Approach Briefing contained in the Air India Express 
B737-800 SOP are well defined. It should be completed before the instrument 
approach wherein the Pilot Flying (Captain in the instant case) should brief the Pilot 
Monitoring (First Officer in this case) of his intentions in conducting the approach. 
Both pilots should review the approach procedure, approach information, minima 
and missed approach procedure, alternatives including landing and stopping 
distance planning.  
 
2.2.7 
Interception of DME Arc 
 
At 05:54:19 hours IST, the First Officer had reported 25 DME MML and the 
Area Control had cleared the aircraft to 2900 feet and to change over to ATC Tower. 
At 05:54:30 hours IST, the First Officer had requested to proceed directly to 338 
radial MML and gave his flight level as 184. There is no established procedure to join 
the DME Arc approach of ILS 24 while approaching MML from IGAMA on radial 287. 
Area Control agreed to his request to proceed and establish radial 338 inbound for 
the 12 DME fix. This is the Initial Approach Fix to commence the 10 DME Arc on 
radial 338 inbound MML. 
 
 
 
Diagram 14: DME Arc Approach for Mangalore Airport 
 
At 05:55:03 hours IST, after establishing contact with ATC Tower, the aircraft 
was advised to join the VOR 10 DME Arc.  At 05:57:42 hours IST, the First Officer 
confirmed having established 10 DME Arc for ILS runway 24, to which ATC Tower 
had advised the aircraft to call when established on ILS.  From 05:55:13 to 05:58:56 
hours IST, the only sounds made by the Captain were of exhaling, yawning and 
throat clearing.  During the same time, the First Officer also made a sound of 
extended yawning and whistling on three occasions. Passing through transition at FL 
095, the First Officer initiated the actions for setting the QNH which was 1006 hPa.  
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
86| 175 
Subsequently, at 05:59:39 hours IST, the Captain ordered the landing gear to be 
lowered. The speedbrakes was already deployed in flight detent position, because of 
the high descent profile. The Captain had realised that he was high. So, he lowered 
the landing gear at this stage to obtain a higher rate of descent.  
 
2.2.8 
Capture of Localiser  
 
Prior to the intercept of ILS, the SOP states that the flap selection should be in 
accordance with flap extension schedule and monitored by the First Officer.  The 
SOP states that the Captain should initiate the completion of ILS preparation prior to 
the intercept of the localiser with ‘Flaps 5’.  As the aircraft was cleared by the ATC 
Tower for the ILS approach, there are mandatory verifications, which need to be 
completed by both Captain and First Officer.   
 
On the first positive inward motion of the localiser pointer, the First Officer 
should have called “LOCALISER ALIVE”, which he did not call. The First Officer 
gave a call of VOR LOC arming and VOR LOC capture.  This call of “VOR LOC 
CAPTURED” at 06:00:24 hours IST appears to be the first time that the localiser was 
captured and the FMA ‘VOR LOC ARM’ (white) turned to ‘VOR LOC CAPTURED’ 
(green).  As per SOP, the localiser capture should have been in ‘Flaps 5’ 
configuration and at appropriate speed.  During the capture mode, aircraft had 
crossed the localiser and after an ‘S’ turn, had recaptured the extended centre line 
on localiser. This was due to selection of ‘Flaps 1’ instead of ‘Flaps 5’ and speed 
higher than stipulated. First Officer had realised this and gave a call “VOR LOC 
 
From the above, it is evident that the Flap selection and Speed Control had 
been delayed with respect to the laid down SOP.  It is pertinent to mention that the 
aircraft was descending with the speedbrakes deployed in flight mode.  
 
2.2.9 
Initial Approach 
 
Having captured the localiser and during an attempt to capture the glide slope, 
at 06:01:01 hours IST and about 9.7 DME, the Captain requested for       “FLAP 10”, 
while descending through 5930 feet. The speed at this time was 202 kt, which was 
higher than the maximum ‘Flap 10’ extension speed. This was checked by a 
questioning tone calling “TEN?” by the First Officer.  The Captain reacted to this 
query and promptly reduced the speed as appropriate. This is not a normal 
sequence of selection of flaps. However, to cater for a descent and speed reduction, 
‘Flap 10’ could be selected as per SOP. 
  
At 7.6 DME, the aircraft was fully established on the localiser and was 
descending passing through 5150 feet altitude with a rate of descent of 1641 ft per 
minute.  Soon after this, a prolonged coughing sound was heard on the Captain’s 
channel.  This was followed by a sound of relief (AAAH!).  At 06:01:57 hours IST, the 
Captain ordered “FLAP 15” while passing through 4630 feet altitude and 6.7 ILS 
DME.   
 
It was observed that the FMA when read from Left to Right has, in the first 
column ARM (white), second column VOR LOC (green) and third column MCP 
speed (green).  The MCP indicated Auto-throttle was ‘Armed’ and level change 
mode was selected with the VOR LOC in ‘Armed Mode’. The altitude window had

indicated 2900 feet.  It is pertinent to mention that the speedbrakes were still 
deployed in the flight detent in spite of selection of ‘Flap 15’. 
 
2.2.10 
Selection of Speedbrakes During Approach 
 
There are panel light indications in front of the flight crew. In front of the 
Captain, the indications are for arming the Speedbrakes, whereas, in front of First 
Officer is a panel light, which reads “SPEEDBRAKES EXTENDED”. The Speedbrake 
control and panel lights are shown below: -

conditions: -

88| 175 
 
At 06:02:43 hours IST, at altitude of 3465 ft, 4.3 ILS DME and a speed of 167 
kt, ‘Flaps 25’ had been selected and the speedbrakes were retracted. This was in 
contravention of the SOP. The Speedbrakes Extended Light remained ‘Amber’ from 
when the flaps were selected beyond 10 to the time the speedbrakes were retracted 
to the ‘Armed’ position after selection of ‘Flaps 25’.  
 
During the critical phases of the approach and after selection of ‘flaps 40’, the 
Captain had redeployed the speedbrakes to Flight Detent at 06:03:26 hours IST. At a 
speed of 155 kt, 1420 ft 1.0 ILS DME, ROD of 3208 ft per minute, pitch attitude was 
9° below the horizon. At 06:04:17 hours IST, 550 ft, 0.2 ILS DME, at a speed of 165 
kt and a ROD of 2535 ft per minute, the speedbrakes were retracted to the flight 
detent position. 
 
Air India Express SOP states that the use of Speedbrakes with the flaps 
extended should be avoided as far as possible. With Flaps 15 or greater, the 
Speedbrakes should be retracted. Speedbrakes should be retracted before 
reaching 1,000 feet AFE. 
 
2.2.11 
High on Approach 
 
At 06:03:14 hours IST, 3.0 DME, ROD 1043 ft per minute, Speed 159 kt and at 
a height of 2815 ft, the Captain had requested for ‘flaps forty’ followed by the landing 
checklist. The landing checklist was done in a challenge and response tone, which 
was very clear and without any hesitation. It was at this time that the flight crew had 
shown correct CRM and alertness. Soon after completing the landing checklist, at 
06:03:33 hours IST, the First Officer had commented “IT IS TOO HIGH”. At this time, 
the airplane was 2.2 DME, 2570 ft, speed 143 kt and a ROD of 1588 ft per minute. 
Two seconds later, the aural call from the Radio Altimeter “TWENTY FIVE 
HUNDRED” was heard. It appears that the First Officer had looked at the visual 
profile and tried to draw the Captain’s attention that the aircraft approach was very 
high. 
 
At 06:03:40 hours IST, 2.0 ILS DME, 142 kt, 2365 ft and a ROD 1671 ft per 
minute, the First Officer had said “RUNWAY STRAIGHT DOWN”. First Officer was 
trying to draw attention of the Captain of higher approach for the second time. At this 
stage, it is evident that the Captain had also seen the runway and said “OH MY 
GOD”. The glide slope mode was engaged at this stage, but due to steep approach, 
a false glide slope was captured. 
 
2.2.12 
Disengagement of Auto-Pilot 
 
At 06:03:43 hours IST, 1.9 ILS DME, 142 kt, 2300 ft and ROD 1508 ft per 
minute, the Captain disengaged the auto pilot and took over the controls manually. 
At 06:03:53 hours IST, 1.5 ILS DME, 1925 ft and ROD 2929 ft per minute, the First 
Officer suggested a ‘GO-AROUND?’ in a mild querying tone. Three seconds later, 
the Captain made a comment of “WRONG LOC - LOCALISER  ........ GLIDE PATH”.  
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
89| 175 
 
2.2.13 
Unstabilised Approach 
 
The AI Express SOP emphasises that the procedures and parameters listed for 
approach, are not mere targets, but are mandatory conditions and limits. Any 
deviation occurring at or beyond the beginning of the stabilised approach requires a 
mandatory ‘go-around’. 
 
After setting the localiser frequency and course, arming the APPROACH 
selects the APPROACH mode. The APPROACH switch illuminates and VOR/LOC 
and Glide Slope annunciate ‘Armed’. The APPROACH mode permits selecting the 
second autopilot to engage in CMD. This arms the second Auto Pilot for automatic 
engagement after LOC and G/S capture; and when descent occurs below 1500 
Radio Altitude. If the First Officer had made the airspeed and sink-rate deviation 
callouts, both the Captain and the First Officer might have been further alerted to the 
fact that the airplane’s airspeed and sink-rate were excessive. When the Captain had 
ordered for Flap 10, the First Officer had enquired “10?” to which the Captain had 
replied, “WAIT A MINUTE”. This indicated that the First Officer had alerted the 
Captain of airspeed being above the flap-load speed. 
 
During the approach and landing, speed had reached 165 kt, in Flap 40 
configuration. As a design feature, at an air speed of 162 kt, the Flap 40 would 
retract to position 30. This is due to the Flap Load Relief System. When the air 
speed reduces to 158 kt, the flaps would extend to 40 position again as per the auto 
function.     
 
The EGPWS warnings were being continuously broadcast in the cockpit, first 
as ‘SINK RATE’ and then ‘PULL UP’. The approach was not conducted in 
compliance with the airline’s guidelines for stabilised approach. It appears that after 
sighting runway, the Captain continued the approach in unstabilised conditions, 
which indicated that he was ‘FIXATED ON THE RUNWAY’. The First Officer did not 
make any call outs regarding the altitude, speed and sink-rate.   
 
2.2.14 
Landing  
 
From a highly unstabilised approach, the Captain had persisted with the 
landing. As deduced from the DFDR, the aircraft was almost 200 ft above the 
threshold and at a speed of 164 kt as compared to 50 feet and 144 kt normally 
applicable for this configuration.  
 
Due to such a high speed, the Flap Load Relief had moved the flaps from 40o 
to 30o and subsequently, when the speed reduced below 158 kt, the flaps got re-
deployed to 40o. This extension during the flare, close to the ground resulted into a 
prolonged float and a late touchdown. The right wheel touched first at about 4500 
feet from the beginning of runway 24. However, the aircraft bounced slightly and it 
finally touched down at about 5200 feet.  
 
2.2.15 
Braking  
 
Although the runway length of 8033 feet at Mangalore is adequate for Boeing 
737-800 operations, most of the pilots prefer to use Auto Brake setting of 3 or MAX 
to ensure timely stoppage of aircraft. However, in the accident aircraft, the Auto 
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
90| 175 
Brake setting was set at 2. After touchdown, the Captain had selected Thrust 
Reversers and commenced braking. It was initially gradual due this setting. 
However, later when the brake pressure had been increased manually, as per the 
aircraft braking system, the aircraft started decelerating much faster. It was brought 
out by the Boeing Test Pilot during Public Hearing that if the Captain had deployed 
detent reverse thrust and had applied maximum manual braking at touchdown, the 
aircraft could have stopped by 7600 feet beyond the R/W 24 threshold i.e. on the 
paved portion of R/W 24.  
 
While such stoppage figures are demonstrable during controlled test flying 
scenarios, these cannot be considered for landings during routine line operations. 
However, if the Captain had initiated maximum manual braking with Thrust 
Reversers, the aircraft could have stopped in the overshoot area and the accident 
might have been averted.  
 
2.2.16 
Accident 
 
After having commenced braking, the Captain made a grave mistake of 
stowing Thrust Reversers and opening full throttle with the intention of going around. 
The Boeing SOP categorically states that during landing, having selected thrust 
reversers, these should not be cancelled to initiate another take off. Despite such 
clear instructions, the Captain had tried to go around. This further aggravated the 
situation and the aircraft impacted the non-frangible ILS mounting structure close to 
the airport fencing and fell into a gorge.  
 
2.2.17 
Pilot Incapacitation 
 
The Cockpit Voice Recorder reveals coherent speech of both pilots during the 
last 17 minutes of the flight before the crash. This included Flap Selection, Landing 
Check Lists by both pilots and identification of wrong glide path by the Captain. 
Further, the DFDR data reveals positive control inputs including disengaging of Auto-
pilot, flying manually by giving control column inputs and deploying Reverse Thrust 
after touch-down. Pilot incapacitation is, therefore, ruled out. 
 
2.2.18 
Aspects of Hard Landing and Going Around  
 
Flight Safety counselling on one-off incident of Hard Landing by Captain for 1.9 
Vg, which was much less than AMM limit of 2.1 Vg cannot be considered as a 
contributing factor towards the accident. Having been consistently unstabilised on the 
ILS Approach, even if the Captain had been able to stop the aircraft on the runway, 
the subsequent FOQA analysis of DFDR and possibly of CVR, would have indicated 
various violations of SOP by the Captain. This would have, in any case, warranted 
another reprimand by the authorities. In a high energy and fast approach, resulting in 
a very late touchdown, no prudent pilot would also aim to make a smooth touchdown 
to avoid flight safety counselling. The aircraft in this instant had not been able to 
remain firmly on the runway because of higher speed at touchdown and not possibly 
because of any attempted smooth landing.  
 
Similarly, having been repeatedly asked by the First Officer to ‘Go Around’, 
from an unstabilised condition, it will not be correct to surmise that raising of an OIR 
for another, but safer approach and landing, would play on the mind of a highly 
experienced Captain.  He should have been aware of having violated correct

procedure on approach and landing. In this case also during the FOQA analysis, such 
violations would have been noticed.   
 
2.2.19 
Incorrect Procedure to Ascertain False ILS Glide Slope   
 
Having analysed that the aircraft was very high on approach, the Captain 
should have co-related the parameters with various laid down cross-references of 
distance, height, speed and rate of descent. As a matter of fact, it is with such cross-
references that a pilot would not only identify a false glide slope, but take corrective 
measures including a ‘Go Around’. It can been seen from the chart below that in 
deviations from the standard 3° Glide Path, the aircraft descends on a steeper path.

Diagram 16: Graph for Descent during False ILS Glide Path 
 
Note: A characteristic of the glide-slope portion of the ILS, in which one or more 
false glide slopes at different angles to the horizontal occur well above the true glide 
slope. This is because of a radiation pattern of the antenna and the ground reflection 
of some of the transmitted energy, resulting in more than one overlapping lobe. The 
false glide slopes occur at odd multiples of the true glide-slope angle (typically 3°) 
(i.e., at 9° and 15°). At even multiples (6°, 12°), a centred glide-slope needle occurs, 
but this is because of a null signal; reverse sensing is present above and below 
these glide slopes. A pilot can easily recognize this false indication by the 
steeper-than-normal rate of descent. Pilots will not experience false glide slopes 
below the true glide-slope angle. Pilots can avoid encountering a false glide 
slope by following published approach procedures.

Flight Crew Performance 
 
2.3.1 
Crew Resource Management (CRM) 
 
The First Officer failed to challenge any of the Captain’s errors as his CRM 
training and experience, should have equipped him to do so. CRM is an effective 
method to use all available resources to achieve a safe and efficient flight. Specific 
issues such as leadership, assertiveness, decision-making, delegation and 
acceptance, as well as crew interaction and communication constitute the basic 
elements of CRM. 
 
The prime objective of CRM training is to produce an atmosphere of sound 
leadship by the Captain. CRM fosters participation by subordinates by encouraging 
Captains to be receptive to their inputs or suggestions. There is a need to encourage 
requisite assertivness in subordinate crew when they express their concerns. 
Interpersonal communications, skills and healthy relationship improves the 
environment for an effective and conducive cockpit environment. Good CRM 
practices and procedures should be reinforced and evaluated as an integral part of 
training during both, Line Oriented Flying Training (LOFT) in simulator and Route 
Training. 
 
2.3.2 
Trans-Cockpit Authority Gradient (TAG) 
 
There are recommendations to maintain stabilised approach criteria. 
Maintaining a stable speed, descent rate and vertical/lateral flight path in landing 
configuration is commonly referred to as the Stabilised Approach. However, the crew 
had compromised safety of the flight. Teamwork or crew coordination in this flight 
was also lacking. 
 
The authority relationship between the Captain and the First Officer appears 
to have reduced the performance of the crew. The Captain had ignored the 
submissive concern of the First Officer about the unstabilised condition of aircraft 
during approach and landing.

There is an optimum ‘Trans-Cockpit Authority Gradient’ to allow effective 
interface between pilots during the flight. In this case the ‘Trans-Cockpit Authority 
Gradient’ was very steep, because of the assertive Captain and a submissive First 
Officer. The reduced performance had resulted in a chain of errors going undetected 
and uncorrected. This steep ‘Trans-Cockpit Authority Gradient’, limited the 
communication skills of both the crewmembers, especially the First Officer who tried 
to draw the attention of the Captain to conduct a ‘Go-Around’ due to unstabilised 
conditions.  The reasons appear to be the authoritative style of the Captain and 
desire of the First Officer to avoid conflict.  
 
Socio-cultural factors also appeared to have played a role in this accident. 
The First Officer had failed to be more assertive when the Captain was continuing 
the approach in unstabilised conditions. Socio-psychological influences can interfere 
with the proper exchange of briefing and standard call-outs; and thus affect safe 
operations. In spite of First Officer clearly advising the Captain of discrepancies, the 
Captain failed to take corrective action. Air India Express therefore, needs to develop 
effective CRM Training that will foster Crew Co-ordination so that the crew develop 
bonding and motivate each other to accomplish team goals over and above their 
individual goals. 
 
2.3.3 
Analysis of Crew Conversation 
  
From the CVR transcript, it was evident that the Captain did not communicate 
with the First Officer, especially during the descent phase and the expected  
instrument approach briefing. There were also indications that the task performance 
was affected because the First Officer did not query or effectively communicate with 
the Captain. Limited communication including omission of a number of crucial and 
mandatory calls affected the crew performance.  
 
The CVR indicated low standard of CRM by both pilots. The First Officer did 
not use an appropriate and assertive style to communicate  with the Captain. The 
technique employed by the crew in flying the approach profile involved a high cockpit 
workload. The crew failed to use the standard height and distance relationship to 
check their vertical profile throughtout the ILS approach. Many aspects of how these 
two pilots communicated to perform routine tasks, suggested that the pilots were not 
working in harmony. 
 
2.3.4 
Monitoring of Training and Evaluation 
 
It was observed that the organisation had not paid adequate emphasis to 
monitor training and subsequent evaluation to raise the standards for Safe operation. 
There was no audit of training requirements.  
 
It was noted that standard industry acronyms were not being used. Instead, 
terms like Supernumerary Under Training (SUT) and Line Oriented Training (LOT) 
appeared in the Training Manual, but not in Air India Express SOP. Training had 
been done with passengers on board and even observation flights had been 
recorded against hours gained towards reckonable experience.

Cabin Crew Performance 
 
All the 4 cabin crew died in this crash. The cabin crew had also not been 
subjected to any pre-flight medical at Mangalore. However, none of the ground staff, 
who interacted with the cabin crew at Mangalore or Dubai had noticed any signs of 
medical problem.  
 
As per the survivors of this ill-fated flight, the cabin crew had been alert and 
co-operative throughout the flight. They had also made the necessary 
announcements regarding switching off the mobile phones and PED; as well as 
safety instructions prior to landing.   
 
From the CVR recording, it can be discerned that the cabin crew had been 
entering the cockpit to enquire whether the flight crew needed any food or 
beverages, which is a normal practice. 
  
2.5 
Airworthiness of Accident Aircraft   
 
Boeing 737 - 800 aircraft VT - AXV, Serial No. 36333, manufactured in 
January 2008 was registered in India with DGCA on 15th January 2008. DGCA had 
granted the Certificate of Airworthiness No 3081. The Aircraft was operating with Air 
India Express since its manufacture. 
 
As per the Air Frame Log Book Entry, Phase - 17 Inspection was carried out 
on this aircraft on 21st April 2010 and the last extended Transit Inspection was 
carried out on 20th May 2010. The aircraft had completed 7199.41 hours and 2833 
landing as on 21st May 2010. The scrutiny of the Engine Log Books indicates that the 
engines were maintained as per the required procedure.  
 
Scrutiny of the aircraft Log Books indicates that the aircraft had been 
maintained in continued airworthiness as per the approved Aircraft Maintenance 
Programme. All the required Mandatory Modifications and Airworthiness Directives 
had been complied with.  
 
The analysis of the defects recorded reveals that the aircraft had not 
experienced any serious snags / defects which might have contributed to the cause 
of accident. The aircraft was released from Dubai to operate the ill-fated flight IX-812 
to Mangalore on 22nd May 2010 with two carry forward snags under MEL. The carry 
forward snags were of minor nature, related to Right Hand Logo Light and Seat No 
25C being un-serviceable.  
 
Post accident inspection carried out on various components indicated that 
both the engines and aircraft systems were serviceable till the time accident. Neither 
pilots had reported any abnormality or emergencies during the flight nor was it 
indicated in the post crash CVR/DFDR analysis.  
 
There was no fire in the flight. Also, during the landing roll, there was no 
indication of deflation or tyre burst prior to the crash. The aircraft was fully 
serviceable and was in a state of airworthiness till the accident. 
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

2.6 
Bird Strike 
 
There was no bird strike reported by the flight crew or any birds sited during 
approach and landing phase of the accident aircraft. The post accident inspection of 
both engines has also confirmed that there was no evidence of any bird strike or bird 
ingestion.    
 
2.7 
Portable Electronic Devices 
 
The Court went through a number of studies carried out regarding 
interference by Mobile phones that were completed by NASA, USA. The Court also 
examined effects of other Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on electronic 
equipment installed on aircraft as well as on ground installations at the airports. The 
Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) trials carried out have not indicated any 
disturbance by mobile phones or PED. Despite such findings, the studies do not rule 
out an odd possibility of interference due to issues such as shielding of cables, 
power output of PED, distance of PED from electronic modules etc. As such, most of 
the operators worldwide do not permit use of mobile phones and PED during the 
critical phases of flight viz take-off and landing.  
 
The survivors had mentioned to the Court that the Cabin Crew had made 
necessary announcements regarding switching off the mobiles and the computers.   
It can also be seen from the analysis of CVR and DFDR data, the aircraft had 
responded as per the inputs given by flight crew, at all phases of the flight, including 
approach and landing. No abnormalities were voiced by any of the flight crew. 
Hence, the interference by PED carried by occupants of the ill-fated flight is ruled 
out. 
 
2.8 
Analysis of Safety Factors at Mangalore Airport 
 
Since Mangalore airfield has a Table Top Runway, Air India Express had 
classified it a critical airfield. As such, it requires special clearance for both the flight 
crew to operate from Mangalore. The Air India Express SOP warrants that only PIC 
should carryout take-off and landing from Critical Airfields. With this caution, it was 
expected that an experienced PIC would have ensured that all the necessary 
approach parameters would be met for a safe landing.  
 
The runway length for R/W 24/06 is 8033 feet, which is more than adequate 
for operations for aircraft such as Boeing 737-800 and Airbus 320 family. The safety 
areas for R/W 24/06 were in accordance with CAR issued by DGCA and Annexure-
14 of ICAO. Hence, it did not contribute to this accident.  
 
2.8.1 
Runway Surface and Friction 
 
The runway surface was dry and not contaminated at the time of the accident.     
A light drizzle had started only after the aircraft had touched down on the runway. 
Although the runway friction values had not been evaluated for one and half year, 
the friction test carried out soon after the accident indicated values of 0.78 mµ to 
0.91 mµ as against the minimum values of 0.40 mµ. Such large variation in friction 
value as compared to 0.64 – 0.66 mµ measured in December 2008, needs further 
examination by AAI in terms of calibration of Friction Tester, types of tyres used on 
the tester and maintenance of runway surface etc.  
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
96| 175 
2.8.2 
Downward Slope in Overshoot Areas 
 
Mangalore being a table top runway with deep valleys and gorges on either 
ends of airport, there should be no downward slope in the overshoot area. This is 
particularly in view of a large number of accidents recently, which have occurred 
during takeoff and landing phases, resulting in runway excursion.  
 
2.8.3 
Maintenance of RESA 
 
Inspection of RESA at Mangalore had revealed that at the time of accident, 
localiser antenna and some temporary concrete platforms for ILS calibration were 
located within RESA. It also lacked regular maintenance. The RESA did not have 
adequate sand refilled as the concrete mounting structure of approach lights were 
protruding above the surface.  Also, there were shrubs and vegetation in RESA as 
evident from the photograph shown below. Regular ploughing of this area would 
have prevented such growth. 
 
 
 
 
 
Photo 30: RESA for R/W 24 at Mangalore on the Day of Accident 
 
 
2.8.4 
Soft Ground Arrestor 
 
In order to help in retarding an aircraft in the overshoot area, ideally, a system 
such as EMAS, be installed at the table top airports. However, in case it is not cost 
effective, then at least a Soft Ground Arrestor (SGA) should be available as part of 
RESA. Such SGA is maintained at all Indian Air Force bases with regular filling of 
sand and ploughing. 
 
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
97| 175 
2.8.5 
Non-frangible ILS Mounting Structure 
 
The ILS structure at Mangalore has a concrete mounting which is non-
frangible. Since the structure is below the surface level of runway, it is not an 
obstacle within the approach or takeoff funnel. However, the Captain on leaving the 
paved surface seemed surprised that such a big structure was present in the 
overshoot area. As per CVR recording, it was evident from his call, “A BIG ONE”. 
Once the downward slope is filled up and brought to the same level as of the 
runway, this non-frangible ILS structure will also get buried below the surface leaving 
only the frangible ILS Localiser Antenna, on the top.  
 
2.8.6 
Strip Width 
 
Due to the constraints of terrain, the strip width is only 150 metres as against 
the mandated 300 metres. This limitation is one of the major permanent concessions 
sought by AAI for licensing of Mangalore airport. Two points emerge from this 
concession. Firstly, there should be no further erosion of strip width and necessary 
engineering precautions need to be taken to ensure this. Secondly, all operators 
would need to impose crosswind limitations during take-off and landings, so as to 
avoid aircraft excursion laterally. 
  
 
2.8.7 
Narrow Roads outside the Perimeter 
 
Considering the risk analysis and the possibility of aircraft overshooting down 
the hill slope beyond the Mangalore airport perimeter, the RFF vehicles like 
Rosenbaur should be able to reach the crash site urgently. For this, the access 
roads should be broad enough, which was not the case around Mangalore airport at 
the time of accident.  
 
2.9 
Analysis of Area Radar Availability  
 
The Area Radar MSSR had a fairly good state of serviceability since its 
installation in the year 2000. There is built in redundancy in terms of alternate rack 
for 24x7 operations. There were adequate first line spares and maintenance support 
available locally for any urgent repairs to ensure continued serviceability of the 
Radar. However, on 20th May the mounting arm had broken for which the spare had 
to be airlifted from Delhi and the radar was made serviceable only on 24th May, 2010.  
 
From 20th May till 24th May the radar remained unserviceable and a NOTAM 
to this effect had been published. Without radar, the area control needed to resort to 
procedural control, which leads to intense R/T activity. On 22nd May 2010, if the 
radar was available the ill-fated flight IX-812 would normally have been given 
descent at 130 DME. However, to ensure safe separation from other traffic the 
descent was given at 77 DME. All flight crew are trained to plan descent from such 
closer distances and if not possible to intercept the ILS DME Arc, the aircraft should 
descend in the ‘HOLDING AREA’ so as to avoid being high on approach. However, 
the flight crew of accident aircraft failed to plan the descent properly.   
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
98| 175 
 
2.10 
Additional Area Radars in the Region 
 
Notwithstanding the fact that the unserviceability of the radar did not 
contribute to the accident, efforts must be made to maintain even higher state of 
serviceability of this MSSR, since this radar has a pivotal role in controlling the 
transiting traffic in this region. 
 
Most of the controllers had suggested to the Court that there should be 
additional Area Radars at Kozhikode and Kochi. This would help in assigning the 
responsibility of radar coverage during periods of unserviceability of Mangalore 
Radar and vice versa. Such redundancy would also help with the projected growth in 
air traffic in the years ahead.  
 
2.11 
Weather Conditions 
  
No significant weather had been either forecasted or reported en-route from 
Dubai to Mangalore.  The visibility at Mangalore was 6 km at the time of accident. As 
such the prevailing weather conditions did not contribute towards the accident.  
 
 
2.12 
Sabotage Aspects 
 
The Bomb Disposal and Detection Squad (BDDS), Chennai, Bureau of Civil 
Aviation Security, had subjected the wreckage, the crash site and the surrounding 
area to explosive examination. In their report, these experts had concluded that there 
was no explosion on board the aircraft prior to the crash. Based on the report by 
BDDS,   sabotage as a cause of the crash was ruled out.  
 
2.13 
Fire 
 
2.13.1 
Fire in Air 
 
There was no report of the aircraft having caught fire in the air by the flight 
crew or by any of the witnesses who observed the accident aircraft on runway. The 
readings of CVR and DFDR have further substantiated this aspect. 
 
2.13.2 
Fire on Ground 
 
On impact with the ILS structure, major portion of the right wing and engine 
had separated from the aircraft. As a result of this impact, the parts had caught fire, 
which were extinguished by the first RFF vehicle.  
 
When the aircraft finally came to rest in the gorge, the aircraft had caught fire. 
This resulted in suffocation and burn injuries, leading to death of crew and 
passengers, other than 8 survivors. A number of parts of the aircraft had also been 
consumed in the fire. The RFF crew of Mangalore had responded well but owing to 
the distance and difficult terrain could not reach the site quicker than about 4-5 
minutes by which time the aircraft had been engulfed in fire. With sustained and 
involved efforts by the airport staff and civil fire department the fire was brought 
under control so that the charred bodies could be removed from the aircraft 
wreckage.

The RFF crew would have contributed to better rescue operations, if the 
Hazard identification and risk management exercises would have taken into account 
possibility of crash outside the airport. Mock drills conducted catering to such 
circumstances would have highlighted the need for better access roads. 
 
2.13.3 
Crowd Control 
 
The crash site was approachable by a narrow and winding road. The 
subsequent RFF vehicles could not reach the crash site as people had crowded the 
roads. The local residents were among the first to help in the rescue operations and 
their help deserves to be appreciated. But, the large crowd of onlookers had 
hindered efforts of the specialist agencies of fire and medical. In this connection, the 
DGCA had issued guidelines vide Air Safety Circular No 03 of 2001. But, these 
guidelines were not available with the executing authorities.  
 
2.14 
Aero medical Aspects 
 
2.14.1 
Medical History of Pilot-in-Command: Captain Z Glusica 
 
2.14.1.1 
General Health 
 
The Captain was a 55 year old pilot who lived near Belgrade, Serbia.  He was 
employed as PIC on Boeing 737-800 in Air India Express w. e. f. 15th December 
2008, after having been issued the Foreign Aircrew Temporary Authorisation (FATA) 
by the DGCA.  His last licensing medical examination, wherein he was declared 
medically fit Class 1 & 2, was held at Belgrade and was valid till 16th August 2010.  
As per the existing DGCA regulations in force, he was not subjected to any licensing 
medical examination for civil flight crew in India.  Other senior flight crew from Serbia 
as well as Indian First Officers had confirmed that he was a non-smoker and 
teetotaller.   
 
His wife and son residing near Belgrade, Serbia, had confirmed to Air India 
Express representative on 15th August 2010, that prior to accident, the Captain had 
been suffering from a “little stomach upset and sore throat”.  His wife had also stated 
that a pouch of medicines recovered from his hotel room at Mangalore, along with 
other personal effects delivered to her, contained Aspirin and some antibiotics. The 
details of these medications could not be established by the Court, since she had 
disposed them off.  One of the First Officers with whom he had flown earlier deposed 
to the Court that the Captain had taken a Vitamin C tablet during a flight and on 
being queried by the First Officer, he had commented that it helped him to stay 
awake.  Analysis of post mortem blood sample of the Captain did not reveal 
presence of any alcohol, sedative or anti-histamines that might have induced 
drowsiness.

2.14.1.2 
Opportunity for Rest 
 
Captain Glusica had returned to Mumbai after his break abroad on             
18th May, 2010 at 2130 hrs by flight AI 126 from Frankfurt. Crew Scheduling 
Department of Air India Express had requested him if he could operate flight IX 811/ 
812 on 21st /22nd May 2010, to which he had agreed.  He had reached Mangalore on 
19th May 2010 from Mumbai by IC-179 and was staying at the Gateway Hotel, 
Mangalore, where he had checked-in during the afternoon of 19th May 2010.  On 
return to India, the Captain had spent one night at Mumbai and two local nights in 
hotel at Mangalore.  This provided him with sufficient opportunity for rest prior to 
undertaking the IX-811 / 812 flight for Mangalore-Dubai-Mangalore sector on 21st 
May 2010.  The time zone difference between Serbia and India is 3.5 hours (with 
daylight saving) and the rest opportunity was adequate to cater to circadian 
desynchronises, if any.  The Court is of the opinion that Air India Express was well 
within the stipulations of the existing FDTL Regulations, in asking the Captain to 
operate the flight. 
 
2.14.1.3 
Personal Professionalism in Flight Crew 
 
Personal professionalism in pilots includes, inter alia, judicious use of rest 
during the allotted hours to avoid fatigue during flying.  It is also not possible to 
ascertain whether a pilot does actually get restful sleep during the time available to 
him. For this, the pilots need to be given training in Fatigue Risk Management.   
 
Similarly, self-medication by flight crew is avoidable.  Ideally, the Captain 
should have consulted an airline doctor regarding his “seemingly trivial” disability.  A 
physician, who has received training in Aviation Medicine, would have clarified 
issues pertaining to the peculiar concerns of flying with “stomach upset and sore 
throat” as well as the implications of flying with medication, if required.   
 
2.14.2 
Medical History of First Officer:  HS Ahluwalia 
 
2.14.2.1 
General Health 
 
First Officer Harbinder Singh Ahluwalia, a 40-year-old pilot belonged to 
Mumbai.  He was unmarried. He was employed as First Officer on Boeing 737-800 in 
Air India Express w. e. f. 27th April 2009, after having served as First Officer with    
Jet Airways for about five years.  From the statements of eye witnesses, who had 
interacted with him at Mangalore and Dubai, it can be surmised that he was in 
apparent good health. Perusal of his Permanent Medical Records (PMR) revealed 
that he was declared temporarily unfit for flying and investigated for Systolic murmur 
and Sinus Tachycardia in March 2001. His tachycardia was attributed to anxiety 
regarding medical exam and he was declared fit in April 2002. Since then he had 
been found fit on all licensing medical examinations. His last licensing medical 
examination was held at AFCME, New Delhi on 11th February, 2010 wherein he was 
declared Fit Class 1 Medical Examination till 10th August, 2010. His colleagues and 
family had confirmed that he was a teetotaller and a non-smoker.

101| 175 
2.14.2.2 
Opportunity for Rest 
 
First Officer Ahluwalia was posted at Mangalore and was sharing an 
apartment in Mangalore with another First Officer of the same airline.  His last flight 
prior to the fateful flight was IX-811/ 812 on 17/ 18th May 2010.  He thus had 
adequate rest period prior to the fateful flight. 
 
2.14.3 
Pre-flight Medical Examination 
 
Air India Express did not have a Medical Officer on its rolls or on contract at 
Mangalore.  No pre-flight medical examination was therefore conducted on any flight 
crew for flights originating from Mangalore.  The DGCA requirement for pre-flight 
medical examination is specified in CAR, Section 5, Air Safety, Series ‘F’ Part III, 
Issue 1 dated 13th November 2009.  This CAR mandates a breathalyser check for all 
crew of at least 40 % flights originating from a station.  However, the requirement for 
100% medical check of all flight crew is not clearly spelt out.  The Handbook on 
Medical Assessment of Civil Flight Crew on the DGCA website (which is stated to be 
a guideline and not to be quoted as authority) identifies the requirement for pre-flight 
medical of all flight crew as a responsibility of Airline Doctors.  Nevertheless, it is 
understood that many other Indian scheduled operators are conducting pre-flight 
medical examination of 100% flight crew from the stations where flights originate.   
 
The hotel staff and Air India Express ground personnel who had interacted 
with the flight crew did not notice anything abnormal about the flight crew on the 
night of 21st May 2010, before IX 811 took off for Dubai.  Similarly, ground personnel 
at Dubai did not find anything abnormal about both flight crew. However, since there 
was definite evidence of coughing and throat clearing by the Captain on the CVR, as 
also since the Captain’s wife had stated that he was suffering from stomach upset 
and sore throat prior to the accident, it is possible that the Captain was not fully fit on 
the day of the flight. 
 
2.14.4 
Evidence and Possible Consequences of Fatigue 
 
2.14.4.1 
Sleep in Cockpit 
 
On the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), there was definite evidence of Capt 
Glusica sleeping on his seat during cruise.  Captain’s heavy breathing, mild snoring 
and light rhythmic breathing was recorded intermittently on the Captain’s microphone 
channel of the CVR while the First Officer had made all the R/T calls.  That the 
breathing pattern was indicative of sleep, was confirmed by CVR experts from 
DGCA, New Delhi as well as those from NTSB, Washington DC, USA.  The typical 
breathing pattern was recorded starting from 11th minute of available 2 hours and 5 
minutes of the CVR recording.  It was recorded intermittently till 21 minutes before 
the accident.  At places, rhythmic breathing (regular cadence) was heard 
immediately after loud R/T calls recorded on the Area Mike.  This suggested that the 
deep sleep was of such quality that it was difficult to be easily aroused or disturbed. 
The CVR had recorded a total duration of 1 hour and 28 minutes of breathing pattern 
/snoring suggestive of deep sleep.  Factors that may have possibly contributed to his 
fatigue, manifesting into uncontrolled sleep are discussed as follows: - 
 
 Operations in WOCL 
 Medical Fitness to undertake the Flight 
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
102| 175 
 
2.14.4.2 
Operations in WOCL 
 
The Captain was operating flight in the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL) 
after a long break from flying duties.  Normal physiology of human sleep suggests 
that it is difficult to maintain arousal and alertness during 02:00 to 06:00 hours, the 
main WOCL period.  In this case, it was further compounded by a break from duties 
demanding such requirements. 
 
2.14.4.3 
Medical Fitness to undertake the Flight 
 
His family had stated that prior to the accident; Captain Glusica was suffering 
from “stomach upset and sore throat”. Throat clearing and coughing sounds made by 
the Captain had been recorded on the CVR. The hotel staff at Mangalore had 
confirmed that Capt Glusica had eaten very little during his stay on 19th, 20th and 21st 
of May 2010.  It was possible that he might have been suffering from mild Upper 
Respiratory Infection. Drowsiness may occur in an individual suffering from fever due 
to “sore throat” even without medication. Although, the laboratory report has 
confirmed that there was no evidence of commonly used sedatives in the Post 
Mortem blood and body samples of Captain Glusica, it is possible that he was not 
fully fit and hence found it difficult to stay awake. 
 
2.14.4.4 
Cumulative Fatigue and Jet Lag 
 
There is no necessity for foreign flight crew proceeding on leave to their home 
town to declare their travel to other countries or carrying out flying during such break. 
Perusal of Captain Glusica’s log book revealed that he had done a 4-hour (5 
landings) flight at Budapest while on leave on 14th May 2010. Also, presently, there 
is no requirement for flight crew to be given more rest to acclimatise after return to 
India, depending on the number of time zones crossed.  A flight crew who spends his 
vacation in Panama or Canada for instance, would not be acclimatised to Indian 
local time within two or three days of return to India due to jet lag.  It may be prudent 
for the airlines to ascertain details of travel of their flight crew during their last week 
of leave abroad. 
  
2.14.4.5 
Sleep Inertia 
 
Arousal from Stage III or Stage IV (slow wave) sleep can lead to sleep inertia, 
where alertness and psychomotor ability is impaired. Duration of such sleep inertia 
may vary amongst individuals and circumstances from a few minutes up to 4 hours, 
but usually less than 30 minutes. There is no direct evidence that sleep inertia 
exhibits a circadian rhythm. However, it appears that sleep inertia is more intense 
when awakening occurs near the trough of the core body temperature as compared 
to its circadian peak. (Tassi P, Muzet A. Sleep inertia in Sleep Med Rev. 2000 Aug; 
4(4):341-353). In view of long duration of sleep, there was a distinct possibility of 
Captain Glusica being in deep sleep (Stage III or IV sleep) before his arousal. The 
sleep inertia was likely to be more intense since it had occurred in WOCL, when the 
core body temperature is normally at its nadir. Such sleep inertia might well have 
persisted till the aircraft had crashed.

2.14.4.6 
Consequences of Fatigue 
 
“When alertness is impaired, people may fix their focus on a minor problem, 
when there is a risk of a major one; may fail to anticipate danger; may display 
automatic behaviour syndrome; may fail to appreciate the gravity of a problem or 
situation; may display flawed logic; and may apply inappropriate corrective actions..” 
(A guide for investigating fatigue: Transportation Safety Board of Canada. & Human 
Factors for Transport Investigators, Canberra, 2 - 6 July 2001). The Captain had 
realised that the flight was high on approach.  This was evidenced by the Captain’s 
remark of “WRONG LOC.. LOCALISER... GLIDE PATH” in response to First 
Officer’s announcement of “RUNWAY STRAIGHT DOWN!”.  At this stage, on 
realising being high on approach, instead of initiating a ‘Go Around’, the Captain had 
chosen to disengage auto-pilot and had manually increased the rate of descent.  
Further, he had persisted in maintaining this steep rate of descent to fulfil his 
intention of making good a landing, despite three unambiguous calls by the First 
Officer to ‘GO AROUND’ and one call of ‘UNSTABILISED’ as well as several aural 
warnings of “SINK RATE” and “PULL UP” by the EGPWS of the aircraft.  Such 
violation of laid down SOP and failure to appreciate the dangerous situation might 
have been partly due to fatigue and sleep inertia.   
 
2.14.5 
The Survivors 
 
Of the 166 occupants on board the ill-fated aircraft, there were 2 flight crew, 4 
cabin crew and 160 passengers.  Passengers included 156 seat occupying persons 
and 4 infants.  All the 6 crew members and 152 passengers had lost their lives in the 
accident.  Only 8 passengers survived the accident.  These included 7 adult males 
and 1 adult female.  The survivors were occupying seat Nos. 7A, 17C, 19A, 19C, 
20C, 21C, 23D and 23F.  Of these, most were grouped from seat rows 17 to 23 and 
only 1 was ahead at 7A. 
 
All survivors in their statements to the Court had spoken of being awake and 
alert to the events as they had unfolded that morning. Among them was a lady 
passenger seated at 7A (a seat she had exchanged with a fellow passenger as she 
was allotted 7B).  This young lady had informed the Court that after landing the 
aircraft appeared to be very fast, but was decelerating along with the sounds 
associated with braking.  However, she had then noticed that the engine sound had 
again increased, which added to her concern.  Her fears were confirmed when she 
felt the aircraft vibrating very severely and then crashing.  She possibly was 
unconscious for a while and remembered waking up in darkness of the passenger 
compartment still harnessed to her seat.  She could see foliage and hence little light 
from her window.  She distinctly remembered undoing her seat belt buckle herself 
and walking rearwards in the dark aisle towards the opening, from where daylight 
was streaming in. She was probably pushed out of the aircraft by another survivor 
and once outside the aircraft had heard the sound of running engine.  
  
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
104| 175 
 
It emerged that once the aircraft had finally come to rest in the gorge, the 
survivors found themselves in darkness inside the aircraft, with a lot of shouts and 
screams from other passengers. They had noticed smoke and fire inside the 
passenger compartment, which seemed to be coming more from the front section.  
All survivors had unbuckled themselves and moved out of their seats to make good 
their escape from a break in the fuselage from where they could see daylight and 
therefore which naturally guided them towards their escape. From the description of 
the survivors it also appeared that the fuselage had broken at a point just behind the 
wings and they had either jumped out or pushed by others through this opening 
created by the broken fuselage. Soon after their escape, while some of them were 
still in the vicinity of the wreckage, the fire had increased.  Some of the survivors had 
sustained burn injuries to their hands and face while escaping from the aircraft.   
 
It is evident that those who survived were fortunate not to receive debilitating 
deceleration injuries like fractures of lower limbs which could have made it virtually 
impossible to make good a quick exit.  Further, their seat locations were close to the 
break in the fuselage from where daylight was coming in. Coupled with their 
situational awareness, this helped them in quickly leaving the aircraft wreckage.  
None of the cabin crew survived the crash and none of the survivors used the over-
wing emergency exits (near Rows 14 & 15), or the exits in the fore or aft sections.  
The break in the fuselage thus appeared to have provided a fortuitous escape path 
for the survivors. 
 
2.14.6 
Requirement for Post-Mortem Examination 
 
2.14.6.1 
Non-availability of DGCA Air Safety Circular 3 of 1984 
 
Post-mortem examinations of all crew and passengers were conducted at five 
different hospitals/ Medical Colleges in Mangalore, under the aegis of Government 
Wenlock Hospital, Mangalore.  Relatives or friends had identified the bodies.  
Although qualified Forensic Medicine specialists had performed the autopsies, they 
were not aware of any specific requirements of post-mortem examinations of air 
crash victims.   
 
The DGCA Air Safety Circular 3 of 1984, which deals with action required by 
Police authorities in case of aircraft accidents, also highlights the specific 
requirements during the conduct of autopsies on the victims including passengers 
and crew.  This circular was not available with the District Administration or Police 
Authorities at Mangalore.  They were in possession of an older circular of 1977 from 
DGCA, which was sketchy in its inputs on post-mortem requirements. Even this 
circular was made available to the specialists conducting the autopsy, only after they 
had already carried out the post-mortems.  
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
105| 175 
 
2.14.6.2 
Requirement of Sealing Personal Effects 
 
Captain Glusica’s personal belongings recovered from his hotel room 
included, among other things, a pouch of medicines.  However, these had been sent 
back to his family prior to examination by the Court.  This information, coupled with 
the fact that his wife and son have talked of his suffering from ‘stomach upset and 
sore throat’, gives reason to believe that the Captain was taking some medicines.  
Since the medicines had been disposed off by his family, it was not possible for the 
Court to assess whether they included some drugs which could have contributed to 
his drowsiness/ sleepiness.  It is considered important to seal all the personal effects 
of the crew in case of an accident and these should be handed over only to the Court 
of Inquiry before releasing them to members of the family.  The Court specifically 
requested RFSL to re-examine the Captain’s blood sample to look for anti-histaminic 
drugs that are among those usually prescribed for ‘sore throat’.  These were found to 
be absent in the sample.  However, knowledge about the exact medications 
available in the pouch could have helped the Forensic Laboratory to confirm their 
consumption, if any. 
 
2.14.6.3 
Special Requirements for Aircraft Accidents Investigation 
 
As a result of paucity of information available to the forensic experts, they 
conducted the autopsies with the primary aim of establishing the identity of the 
victims and establishing cause of death.  In an aircraft accident, in addition to these 
objectives, carefully performed autopsies on crew and passengers can shed light on 
several aspects that may help in establishing the cause of the accident and to 
understand aspects of survivability and injuries to occupants.  Both these aspects 
can be useful in suggesting remedial measures.   
 
2.14.6.4 
Toxicological and Chemical Analysis 
 
Similarly, the toxicological analysis of blood/ urine/ body samples of flight crew 
to specifically look for presence of alcohol, lactic acid and carbon monoxide are 
mandated by the DGCA circular.  This can provide vital evidence to the Court.  In the 
instant case, the samples were collected from bodies of both flight crews to the 
extent possible.  However, the police authorities had not submitted these samples for 
forensic laboratory analysis immediately.  In fact the samples were forwarded to 
RFSL, Mangalore only after the Court had directed Police to do so on 11th July 2010.  
Such delay in analysis of samples can lead to inaccuracy in reporting and is 
avoidable.  In addition, the DGCA Air Safety Circular No 3 of 1984 does not require 
analysis of collected samples to be tested for presence of prescription and over-the-
counter medications. However, such analysis would be important to rule out 
consumption of all types of medication.   
 
2.14.6.5 
Availability of Specialist in Aviation Medicine 
 
After the accident, no Aviation Medicine Specialist had visited the crash site. It 
was at the behest of the Court that on 6th June 2010 an Aviation Medicine Specialist 
of DGCA visited Mangalore. Later on, Group Captain Gaur was inducted as an 
additional Assessor.

Although several autopsies had been conducted painstakingly by the experts, a 
large number of passengers’ autopsy reports had been Diagramy. The cause of 
death in some of these was mentioned as ‘Due to Mechanical and Thermal Injuries’.  
However, no details of fractures or burns had been recorded.  Due to lack of such 
information it was difficult to fully understand the aspects of crash force dynamics 
leading to deceleration injuries and to address issues of survivability of passengers.  
Similarly, no post-mortem X-rays of the flight crew had been conducted.  X-rays can 
often provide crucial evidence about the axis of deceleration forces, by means of 
assessing injuries to vertebrae and long bones.  X-rays of the small bones of the 
hand can provide corroborative evidence as to which pilot was on controls at the 
time of impact. These aspects could have been addressed if a specialist in Aviation 
Medicine was attending the autopsies and guiding the Forensic Medicine experts in 
the same. 
 
2.14.6.6 
Tagging and Identification of Bodies 
 
The bodies of all crew and deceased passengers were transported from the 
crash site to various hospitals with the help of local volunteers and fire fighters.  The 
importance of tagging the bodies to establish their location in the wreckage (seat 
numbers or fore/ aft galley as applicable) was not known to the local authorities and 
was therefore not done. It was therefore difficult to establish the identities of 
occupants and to know for certainty their actual seating in the aircraft. This issue was 
highlighted in the deposition by one of the Forensic experts who conducted the 
autopsies. It is important that the officers supervising the rescue operations know 
these aspects, so that they can guide the fire fighters and rescuers accordingly. 
 
In view of the above issues, a comprehensive revision of the DGCA Air Safety 
Circular 3 of 1984 as well as its dissemination to all authorities is considered 
essential. 
 
2.14.7 
Post-Mortem Findings 
 
2.14.7.1 
Post-Mortem Report of Capt Z Glusica 
 
The Captain’s autopsy was conducted in Father Muller Medical College, 
Mangalore, on 22nd May 2010. The body was identified by his passport size 
photographs and printed pieces of paper found on his person. It was evident that the 
Captain had died of deceleration injuries sustained on impact. The coronaries were 
normal and patent, which indicated that there was no evidence of Myocardial 
Infarction (Heart Attack).  The cause of death was written as ‘due to multiple injuries 
sustained in the aircraft accident consistent with the history provided.’ The viscera 
and blood samples were preserved to assess blood alcohol levels and carbon 
monoxide.  The report of the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL), 
Mangalore, dated 25th  August 2010 on the analysis of these specimens stated that 
the samples were negative for, inter alia, Alcohol, Nifedipine, Temazepam, 
Diazepam, carboxyhaemoglobin and common anti-epileptic drugs. In view of 
Captain’s prolonged sleep, these samples were additionally tested for anti-
histamines. The result was negative.

2.14.7.2 
Post-Mortem Report of First Officer HS Ahluwalia 
 
The First Officer’s autopsy was conducted at the Dept of Forensic Medicine, 
Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore on 23rd May 2010.  The body was identified by 
the presence of yellow coloured chain and locket as well as by evidence of a 
surgery, which was confirmed by the relatives.  Major deceleration injuries were 
noted. Samples of the stomach and its contents as well as parts of other relevant 
organs were forwarded to RFSL, Mangalore.  The results from the laboratory report 
dated 25th August 2010 were negative for Alcohol, Nifedipine, Temazepam, 
Diazepam and common anti-epileptic drugs.  Carboxyhaemoglobin could not be 
estimated. 
 
2.14.7.3 
Post-Mortem Report of Passengers and Cabin Crew 
 
Most of the autopsy reports for passengers and cabin crew revealed presence 
of charring.  A large number of bodies were found in pugilistic attitude, suggestive of 
severe burns.  A number of bodies also had evidence of decelerated injuries, in 
addition to burn injuries.  Only a few bodies had evidence of decelerated injuries with 
minimal or nil burns and one body neither had burns nor decelerated injuries. Cause 
of death for this child had been given as Asphyxia due to smoke inhalation. The eight 
survivors were all from a common area in the middle of the fuselage, except for one 
lady who was seated at 7A.  A LOPA with colour coding of 8 survivors and nature of 
injuries to the deceased passengers has been prepared after analysing autopsy 
reports. The LOPA is shown at Para 1.15.3 of Factual Information.  It was evident 
that most of the passengers had died due to burns sustained in the post impact fire.  
Some passengers who had survived the deceleration forces of impact, but were 
injured or disoriented in the darkness, could not possibly escape from the burning 
aircraft.  It is pertinent to mention that all survivors had stated that not only were they 
fully awake at the time of landing, but were observant of the noise and vibrations, 
which were not normal and made them anticipate the disaster in some manner. 
 
 
2.15 
Analysis of ATC and Flight Recorders: 
 
2.15.1 
ATC Recorder Analysis 
  
The recording of ATC Tape was also available on the CVR recording. 
However, some of the significant observations of ATC Tape Recording were as 
follows: 
 
 The aircraft came in contact with Area Control at 05:32:50 hours IST and 
was reported to be flying at FL-370. 
  
 After reporting point IGAMA, the aircraft had asked for descent clearance 
at about 130 miles DME. The pilot was informed of unserviceability of the 
Area Radar. He was denied permission to descend at 130 DME.  
 
 Aircraft was advised to carry out ILS DME Arc approach for R/W 24. 
 
 ATC had informed the pilot about weather at Mangalore at 05:37:06 hours 
IST and visibility of 6 km.  
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
 
 
 
108| 175 
 
 Aircraft was given clearance for descent at 80 DME.  
 
 Area Control handed over the aircraft to ATC Tower at 05:54:51 hours IST 
when the aircraft was on DME Arc. 
 
 Since there was no call from aircraft for seeking landing clearance, the 
ATC Controller had queried the pilot, if the aircraft was stabilised on ILS 
glide path. 
 
 On confirmation from the pilot, aircraft was given landing clearance 
 
 There was a call on VHF channel of ATC Tower by the First Officer asking 
Captain to ‘GO AROUND’. 
 
 After the late touchdown and unable to see the aircraft at the end of R/W 
24, the ATC had given a routine call to the aircraft to backtrack (and taxi to 
aircraft parking bay). 
 
After any accident, the ATC tape is required to be sealed. However, due to 
some unexplained reasons, the media had reported about the First Officer having 
given a call to the Captain to ‘GO AROUND’.  
 
2.15.2 
Digital Flight Recorder (DFDR) Analysis 
  
The Salient observations were as follows: 
 
 The descent from 37000 ft had commenced at 05:47:37 hours IST at      
77 DME. 
 
 At 05:56:57 hours IST at an altitude of 28952 ft Speedbrakes were 
deployed. The deflection of the speedbrakes handle had increased from 
3.66 ˚ to 30.67˚ and the corresponding deflection of the spoilers 3, 4, 9 and 
10 was 7.6˚, 18.19˚, 16.88˚ and 6.91˚ respectively. 
 
 Aircraft had entered 10 DME ARC at 05:58:40 hours IST, when the 
heading was 93.5˚, air speed was 251 kt and pressure altitude was 10496 
ft. It had exited the DME Arc and aligned with R/W 24 heading at 06:01:41 
hours IST, at 7.5 DME, IAS 178.8 kt, Pressure Altitude 5263 ft. 
 
 Speedbrake handle and corresponding spoilers were retracted at 06:02:50 
hours IST at altitude of 3767ft. Speedbrakes were again deployed from 
06:04:03 to 06:04:21 hours IST, wherein corresponding pressure altitude 
had decreased from 1661 ft to 720 ft. 
 
 At 06:04:41 hours IST, Weight on Wheel (WOW) was indicated on right 
wheel. 
 
 Flap 1 was selected at 7000 ft, subsequently flap 5, 10, 15 and 40 were 
selected. Flap 40 was selected at an altitude of 3000 ft. At 06:04:22 hours 
IST while flap lever was at 40, the flap surface moved to 30 at IAS of 165 
kt at altitude of 650 ft.

 EGPWS aural warnings of “SINK RATE” had come from 06:04:05 hours 
IST to 06:04:07 hours IST at 1500 ft Pressure altitude and again came 
from 06:04:13 hours IST to  06: 04:14 hours IST at 1100 ft. GPWS “PULL 
UP” warning came from 06:04:15 hours IST to 06:04:25 hours IST at 
Pressure Altitude of 1000 ft. EGPWS “SINK RATE “warning had again 
come from 06:04:26 hours IST to 06:04:28 hours IST at Pressure Altitude 
of 560 ft and finally at 100 ft. 
 
 Weight on Wheel on both the main gears was recorded at 06:04:43 hours 
IST, the vertical acceleration recorded at this point was 1.5 Vg.                
At 06:04:45 hours IST, WOW was recorded on the Nose gear with vertical 
acceleration of 1.2 Vg. 
 
 Auto brakes were deployed from 06:04:42 hours IST to 06:04:48 hours 
IST. Thereafter, manual brakes were utilised temporarily. 
 
 At 06:04:45 hours IST, thrust reversers were deployed. 
 
 From 06:04:55 hours IST to 06:04:57 hours IST, the thrust reversers were 
in transit. The throttle resolver angle of Left and Right engine was 
increased to 83.87 and during this period, the speed was 79 kt. 
 
 At 06:04:59 hours IST, both fuel flow and EGT had started rising. 
 
 At 06:05:03 hours IST, at the end of DFDR recording, the speed was 55 kt. 
 
2.15.3 
Cockpit Voice recorder (CVR) Analysis 
 
The salient observations from the CVR recordings were as follows: 
 
 The recording started at 03:59:50 hours IST, while the airplane was in 
cruise flight. First Officer was handling the radio communication with ATC 
and was also doing the position reporting.  
  
 Captain’s voice was not heard for the first 1 hour and 40 minutes of the 
recording. Throughout this period, sounds of deep breathing / snoring / 
nasal breathing were heard intermittently on the mixed channel recording. 
 
 Aircraft had come in contact with Area Control Mangalore at 05:32:49 
hours IST. At 05:32:52 hours IST, the aircraft had transmitted its flight 
level “FL 370”, SSR squawk code 0544 and position “APPROACHING 
IGAMA”.  The Area Control had intimated the Mangalore weather, runway 
in use as 24, and had also intimated that ILS DME arc approach was 
available.   
 
 At 05:38:48 hours IST, aircraft had intimated that it was ready for descent. 
Area Control had instructed aircraft to report on radial 287 MML and 80 
miles from MML for descent.

110| 175 
 At 05:46:53 hours IST, aircraft had reported at 80 DME on radial 287 from 
MML. At 05:47:21 hours IST, when aircraft was at 77 DME from MML, it 
was given descent clearance to 7000 feet. 
 
 
 At 05:54:19 hours IST, aircraft had reported its position as 25 DME from 
MML. 
 
 At 05:54:24 hours IST, aircraft was given descent to 2900 (entry altitude 
of DME Arc) feet and was instructed to contact ATC Tower on 122.1 MHz. 
Aircraft had requested to directly proceed to 338 radial, which was 
approved by Area Control. 
 
 At 05:54:50 hours IST, aircraft had contacted Mangalore Tower. 
 
 At 05:57:42 hours IST, aircraft had reported established on 10 DME Arc 
for runway 24. ATC then instructed aircraft to report when established on 
ILS. 
 
 At 06:00:40 hours IST, a call “VOR-LOC CAPTURED” was recorded on 
First Officer’s channel. 
 
 At 06:03:55 hours IST, “WRONG LOC-LOCALISER……GLIDE PATH” 
was recorded on Captain’s and Mixed Channel recording. 
 
 AT 06:04:06 hours IST, EGPWS warnings of “SINK RATE” and a call for 
“GO AROUND” and “UNSTABILISED” was recorded on First Officer’s and 
Mixed Channel recording.  
 
 At 06:04:10 hours IST, ATC Tower had asked aircraft “CONFIRM 
ESTABLISHED ON ILS”. To this, the aircraft had replied “AFFIRMATIVE”. 
The EGPWS aural warnings of “SINK RATE” and “PULL UP” were 
concurrently recorded. 
 
 At 06:04:17 hours IST, ATC Tower had intimated “WINDS CALM” and had 
cleared the aircraft for landing on runway 24.  This was followed by 
EGPWS aural warnings of “PULL UP”.  
 
 At 06:04:38 hours IST, there was a call of “GO-ROUND CAPTAIN” 
recorded on First Officer’s channel, which had also been transmitted on 
VHF channel to ATC. 
 
 At 06:04:41 hours IST, there was a call recorded on First Officer’s 
Channel “WE DON’T HAVE RUNWAY LEFT”.  This was followed by 
configuration warning horn, sound of loud impact and EGPWS warning of 
“BANK ANGLE”. Subsequently, there was no recording. 
 
2.15.4       Data Co-relation of Recorders 
 
The data from all the Recorders was corroborated for time co-relation as well 
as sequence of events during the flight. Apart from marginal time difference, there 
were no deviations.

2.16 
Circumstances Leading to The Crash of The Aircraft 
 
There were four factors typical to this accident. Firstly, the accident aircraft 
belonged to Air India Express, a low cost carrier operating under the ambit of Air 
India, a legacy carrier with different philosophy of operations. Secondly, it was a QTA 
flight being flown through the night, including the period of Window of Circadian Low. 
Thirdly, the aircraft was operating from a Table Top airport at Mangalore, which as 
per the SOP of Air India Express had warranted only the PIC to undertake take off 
and landing, thereby highlighting the need for higher skill. Lastly, the flight crew was 
combination of a foreign PIC and an Indian First Officer, who possibly lacked CRM 
due to mixed cultural issues. 
 
Late First Officer Ahluwalia was known to be a stickler for following SOP. This 
was reiterated by not only the pilots who had flown with him in Air India Express, but 
also by pilots of Jet Airways with whom he was employed earlier. During 
investigation, it came to light that First Officer Ahluwalia had complained in writing 
about one Foreign Pilot to the management of Air India Express. The management 
was yet to counsel him and the Foreign Pilot. Possibly, due to such feelings, the First 
Officer did not try to wake up the Captain, who was sleeping. It is evident from the 
CVR that there had been practically no conversation between the two pilots for a 
prolonged period of time, made worse by the Captain having slept for a considerable 
period.  
 
It is also evident from the CVR that the flight crew had failed to carry out the 
required Descent Preparation Checks prior to descent. It is pertinent to note that the 
First Officer, who was known to be a strict follower of SOP, had also failed in this 
respect. However, the CRM was not effective, as evident in this case; a casual tone 
set by the Captain might have also affected the First Officer. This was evident from 
the selection of ‘000’ on the altitude select window of the Mode Control Panel (MCP) 
instead of Missed Approach Altitude of 2200 ft during approach. Such serious 
contravention of SOP was apparently not noticed by either of the pilots.   
 
That the CRM has not been effective is also evident from a very steep Trans-
Cockpit Authority Gradient. Many Pilots, who had flown with PIC, had mentioned to 
the Court that although the Captain was quite friendly, he was also more assertive 
and would display an attitude of ‘I am right’. This aspect is evident when in reply to 
R/T call by ATC Tower ‘EXPRESS INDIA 812 CONFIRM ESTABLISHED’, although 
not correctly positioned on the ILS Glide Path, the Captain had somewhat forced the 
First Officer to give a call, ‘AFFIRMATIVE’. 
 
Such ineffective CRM and the steep Trans-Cockpit Authority Gradient could 
have affected the First Officer from taking over controls and forcing a ‘Go Around’ in 
an assertive manner. 
 
The Captain had disconnected the Auto Pilot and was descending at a very 
high rate of 1500 feet per minute to try and intercept the correct approach path. Apart 
from this, there had been a series of mistakes right from top of the descent till 
touchdown. Such gross errors should have been discernable to the Captain 
considering his vast experience of 10000+ hours. The likely explanation for these 
errors was sleep inertia caused by long and deep sleep during cruise. 
Analysis                                                                                      Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

2.17 
Why did the Accident Take Place? 
 
The accident was caused by a chain of multiple errors that took place right 
from the top of descent. This ‘error chain’ is evident in a series of mistakes 
committed by both the Flight Crew and in particular the Captain.  
 
There was no pre-flight medical of the flying crew at Mangalore prior to 
departure for QTA flight Mangalore-Dubai-Mangalore. However, all personnel who 
had interacted with the flight crew had indicated to the Court that they had not 
observed any signs of medical illness. The post-mortem carried out after the 
accident indicated no reports of any alcohol or self-medication by either the Captain 
or the First Officer. There was, however, a pouch of medicines in the Gateway Hotel 
Room occupied by the Captain. The Court could not examine the contents of the 
medicine pouch since these were inadvertently sent back to his family residing in 
Serbia. However, the family had responded that the Captain was suffering from 
‘stomach upset and sore throat’. However, the Toxicology Report had not indicated 
consumption of any medicine by the Captain. 
 
 The Captain had slept for a considerable period of time during the cruise 
phase. It was evident from the CVR recording that the Captain had been sleeping in 
his seat for about 1 hour and 40 minutes. On waking up, there was a distinct 
possibility of his transiting into conditions of sleep inertia.  
 
Some of the airlines such as Air Canada allow Controlled Rest in Seat in two- 
man cockpit like Boeing 737-800. Their SOP spells out a number of activities which 
must be completed prior to the rest period such as transfer of flight duties, co-
ordination with flight attendants etc. The SOP also specifies that the rest period 
should be for a maximum of 45 minutes to avoid Sleep Inertia. Also, such Controlled 
Rest should be completed at least 30 minutes prior to planned top of descent. The 
Canadian Air Regulation also mentions that it takes about 15 minutes after 
awakening to be fully awake and take over the flight duties. 
 
The Captain, therefore, may have suffered from conditions of sleep inertia 
resulting into clouding of judgement. Possibly, this was further affected by flying in 
the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL). 
 
The resultant casual tone in the cockpit was evident with inadequate briefing 
and not following the SOP correctly. The First Officer had possibly been affected by 
both induced sleep as well as casual atmosphere in the cockpit.  
 
As evident, there was lack of CRM and crew coordination. Due to this, the 
accident was in the making on the approach itself. Although the First Officer had 
been aware of incorrect parameters and unstabilised approach, the steep Trans-
Cockpit Authority Gradient had resulted in the Captain overruling suggestions for 
going around by the First Officer. With the First Officer not showing any signs of 
assertiveness, the Captain had continued with the faulty approach and landing, 
possibly due to incorrect assessment of his own ability to pull off a safe landing. This 
violation of laid down SOP by the Captain can be attributed to fatigue, sleep inertia 
and the phenomenon of ‘GET-OVER-WITH-IT’. 
Conclusion                                                                                 Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

Conclusion            
       
       
3.1 
Findings 
 
3.1.1 
The Captain and the First Officer of Air India Express flight IX-812 had 
appropriate licence to undertake the flight. 
 
3.1.2 
The crew had not been subjected to a Pre-flight medical examination. 
However, based on statements by the witnesses who met/saw the crew 
prior to the flights, IX-811 from Mangalore and IX-812 from Dubai, there 
was no evidence indicating any adverse medical or behavioural condition 
with the flight crew. 
 
3.1.3 
As per the flight schedule, flight crew had sufficient off-duty time prior to 
the flight, to avail adequate rest. 
 
3.1.4 
The accident aircraft Boeing 737-800 VT-AXV had a current Certificate of 
Airworthiness. The aircraft had undergone various inspections as per the 
required schedule of maintenance. 
 
3.1.5 
There was no evidence to indicate any pre-existing failures of the engine, 
airframe or any other aircraft systems. Two defects, minor in nature, were 
carried forward under MEL, one relating to passenger seat 25C and other 
relating to the Right Hand Tail Logo Light from Dubai, for the ill-fated QTA 
return flight to Mangalore. 
 
3.1.6 
As indicated by the DFDR, the aircraft was fully serviceable throughout its 
flight till the actual crash. As per the CVR, the crew had also not reported 
any un-serviceability. 
 
3.1.7 
As indicated on the CVR, the Captain was asleep with sounds of 
intermittent snoring and deep breathing heard for the first 1 hour and 40 
minutes of the recording, out of the total of 2 hour and 5 minutes. This had 
possibly led to sleep inertia and impaired judgement. 
 
3.1.8 
The descent from FL 370 would have normally been at about 130 DME 
from MML. However, it was delayed since the Area Radar was 
unserviceable and the controller had to resort to Procedural Control for 
ensuring safe separation with other air traffic. 
 
3.1.9 
The crew had failed to plan the descent profile so as to arrive at correct 
altitude for positioning into ILS approach. The First Officer had said on the 
intercom to the Captain “RADAR NOT AVAILABLE, BUT I DO NOT 
KNOW WHAT TO DO.” This indicated that he was possibly not aware of  
procedure in case the radar was not available and in such a scenario, how 
to plan a descent and approach if not permitted by the Area Control to 
descent at the desired distance on DME. 
 
 
 
Conclusion                                                                                 Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore 
 
 
 
114 | 175 
 
3.1.10 
In case of fatigue and flying in the period of Window of Circadian Low 
(WOCL) or for any other reason, it would have been better to programme 
descent with use of the auto pilot, to arrive correctly for the ILS approach.    
 
3.1.11 
Mangalore being a Table Top Airport requiring Special Qualification, the 
Captain was the PIC and was at the controls during landing and at the 
time of accident.  
 
3.1.12 
The First Officer had correctly identified that the aircraft was in an 
‘unstabilised approach’. He had also asked the Captain to ‘GO AROUND’ 
three times. 
 
3.1.13 
At about 1.7 DME on final approach, having realised that the aircraft was 
too high, the Captain had intentionally disconnected the auto pilot and 
increased the rate of descent to re-establish on visual profile for Runway 
24. Both these actions by the Captain indicate that he was actively 
engaged in controlling the aircraft. This confirmed that the Captain was not 
in-capacitated in any manner. 
 
3.1.14 
The Captain had failed to cross check the altitude and corresponding 
distance on approach. In spite of number of warnings to the contrary, the 
Captain had persisted with approach and landing. He had not only touched 
down late, but also did not apply the brakes appropriately. Moreover, the 
PIC had attempted to ‘Go Around’ after having selected the thrust 
reversers, which is categorically prohibited in the SOP. 
 
3.1.15 
The visibility at the time of landing was 6 km and surface wind calm. The 
runway surface was dry.  
 
3.1.16   
There was no evidence of any bird strike on the aircraft. 
 
3.1.17 
There was no evidence to indicate any sabotage to have caused the 
accident. 
 
3.1.18 
There was no evidence of any interference by Portable Electronic Devices 
such as mobile phones and laptop computers on ground or airborne 
electronic equipment. 
 
3.1.19 
There was no evidence of any pre-impact failure or in-flight fire. 
 
3.1.20 
The aircraft overran the runway including the strip and the RESA. It then 
impacted the concrete mounting structure of ILS Localiser Antenna and fell 
into a gorge. In the resultant impact and post crash fire, 152 passengers 
and all 6 crew members lost their lives. There were 8 survivors.  
 
3.1.21 
The Court observed that despite the constraints of terrain surrounding the 
Table Top runway, the Rescue and Fire Fighting operations had been 
carried out with due diligence.  
 
Conclusion                                                                                 Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore 
 
 
 
115 | 175 
 
3.2 
Cause of the Accident 
 
3.2.1 
Direct Causes  
 
The Court of Inquiry determines that the cause of this accident was Captain’s 
failure to discontinue the ‘unstabilised approach’ and his persistence in continuing 
with the landing, despite three calls from the First Officer to ‘go around’ and a 
number of warnings from EGPWS.  
 
3.2.2 
Contributing Factors to the Accident 
 
3.2.2.1 
In spite of availability of adequate rest period prior to the flight, the Captain 
was in prolonged sleep during flight, which could have led to sleep inertia. 
As a result of relatively short period of time between his awakening and 
the approach, it possibly led to impaired judgment. This aspect might have 
got accentuated while flying in the Window of Circadian Low (WOCL). 
 
3.2.2.2 
In the absence of Mangalore Area Control Radar (MSSR), due to un-
serviceability, the aircraft was given descent at a shorter distance on DME 
as compared to the normal. However, the flight crew did not plan the 
descent profile properly, resulting in remaining high on approach. 
 
3.2.2.3 
Probably in view of ambiguity in various instructions empowering the ‘co-
pilot’ to initiate a ‘go around’, the First Officer gave repeated calls to this 
effect, but did not take over the controls to actually discontinue the ill-fated 
approach. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

4. 
Recommendations 
 
As a result of the investigation into the Mangalore air crash, the Court of 
Inquiry makes the following recommendations:-             
 
4.1 
For the Parent Company Air India and the Operator Air India Express 
 
4.1.1 
Air India Express Should Operate as a Separate Entity 
 
The DGCA regulations mandate that a separate AOP holder like Air India 
Express should operate as an independent organisation instead of being operated 
by part time Post Holders on deputation from Air India.  
 
The philosophy of operations of Air India Express is vastly different from Air 
India. While Air India is a legacy airline which operates on long haul international 
routes, Air India Express is a low cost airline operating to destinations in the Middle 
East, South and South East Asia. Air India Express also operates from multiple 
bases which make its operations vastly different from Air India.  
 
Functions of marketing, commercial, administration and even some aspects of 
engineering and logistics support can be synergised with the parent company. 
However, those of operations, training and flight safety should be independently 
managed by Air India Express.   
 
4.1.2 
Need for Calibrated Growth of Air India Express    
 
Since its inception in 2005, Air India Express had grown rapidly from a mere 3 
aircraft to 25 aircraft in a short span of 4 years. It had also done well to increase 
number of flights from 26 to about 210 per week in 2009. It is given to understand 
that there would be further induction of aircraft and operations on new routes 
including domestic sectors. In order to connect more cities with international routes, 
AI Express also plans to operate form additional bases. There would also to be an 
independent engineering setup to be started at Thiruvananthapuram shortly. 
 
While such growth has its merits, there is a need to ensure that along side 
other resources, infrastructure and in particular induction of duly qualified manpower 
also takes place. While inducting flight crew to cater to this increased requirement, 
issues such as training and flight safety should be given prime importance.  
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
117 | 175 
 
4.1.3 
Post-Holders in Air India Express 
 
At the time of accident, the parent company Air India (NACIL-A) continued to 
depute pilots not qualified on Boeing 737-800 aircraft as Post Holders to supervise 
various functions of Air India Express. In view of the separate AOP issued to AI 
Express, there is a need for Post Holders particularly of Operations, Flight Safety 
and Training to be qualified on type.  
 
Since operating philosophy of the low-cost AI Express is from multiple bases, 
all supervisors should endeavour to fly from various sectors. This would make them 
familiar with peculiarities of routes, operating conditions, fatigue issues and in getting 
to know more number of flying crew stationed at these bases, which will in turn 
enhance “communication” and rapport. 
 
4.1.4 
Computerised Network for all Activities 
 
In view of Multi-base operations of Air India Express, there is an urgent need 
to computerise both, intra and inter departmental activities. Currently followed use of 
Pencil and Eraser to maintain crew schedules leads to ambiguity and lack of 
transparency. In order to obviate this, it is recommended that all crew schedules 
should be computerised urgently in keeping with CAR Section 3, Series ‘C’ Part II 
(Revised 2009) issued by DGCA.  This non-compliance had also been brought out 
by the DGCA Audit carried out from 30th October to 3rd November 2007.   
 
During the process of investigation, it was also revealed that the commercial 
staff was not aware of MEL release on Seat No 25C and the same was wrongly 
allotted to a passenger from Dubai.  With inter-departmental networking, such errors 
can be overcome. 
 
Use of Computers will also allow an efficient and faster means of 
communications with the flight crew operating from multiple bases. Changes to 
operating instructions or any flight safety alerts can also be made known to them at 
the earliest. 
 
4.1.5 
Flight Safety Management 
 
4.1.5.1 
FOQA and CVR Analysis in Multi-Base Operations 
 
The mandatory analysis of CVR is presently being carried out only for flights 
operating into Mumbai. Such sample checks also need to include flights operating 
from different bases and for monitoring performance of crew operating from bases 
other than Mumbai. 
 
In view of the multiple base operations, 100% FOQA analysis of DFDR takes 
up to 3 weeks. For faster monitoring of various parameters, this duration could be cut 
down  by Computerisation and Networking. 
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
118 | 175 
 
4.1.5.2 
Flight Safety Counselling to Flight Crew    
 
Flight Safety Counselling of flight crew should be participative and aimed at 
correcting a serious violation or if indicative of any trend of errors.  It should be non-
punitive, unless absolutely necessary.  The session should be non-intimidating and 
efforts should be made to ensure that flight crew view the process positively.  
However, errors/ violations and corrections if required should be spelt out clearly and 
unambiguously.  During counselling, flight crew should also be appreciated for 
positive flight safety enhancement actions or ‘Good Shows’, if any. 
 
4.1.5.3 
Need for Internal Safety Audit 
 
 
There is a need to carry out Internal Safety Audit of all bases and line stations 
by Flight Safety Department at frequency as stipulated in CAR Section 5, Series F, 
Part 1. Such Audit must include all departments like Operations, Engineering, 
Training and Commercial. The outsourced activities like Ground Handling, 
Catering/Flight Kitchen and Security etc must also be audited to identify any Safety 
concerns and to mitigate them. 
 
4.1.6 
Training 
 
Air India Express has a mixed intake of Pilots. While there are Captains and 
First Officers employed directly on contract, First Officers from Air India are also sent 
to AI Express for Command conversion. In addition, a number of foreign pilots have 
also been employed, who need to be given familiarisation training for operating in 
Indian conditions. There is also a need for recurrent training including various 
clearances and checks. There is a shortage of TRI and TRE which needs to be 
addressed urgently. 
 
The emphasis should be on a common SOP for such a mixed crew. During 
training, endeavour should also be made on inculcating a common company culture 
amongst the crew. Aspects such as CRM, actions during unstabilised approach, use 
of Vertical Situation Display (VSD), identification of false Glide Slope etc., should be 
covered in ground training and where possible, in simulator.  
 
In addition to this large requirement of training, Air India Express needs to 
develop its own infrastructure for carrying out training especially in view of the 
constraint of Multi-base operations.  
 
Since AI Express operates on shorter sectors, criteria for various 
qualifications should be more on numbers of take-offs and landings and not on total 
hours flown.  
 
The ground training should include aspects of Aviation Medicine including 
fatigue management, effects of alcohol, self-medication etc. 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
119 | 175 
 
4.1.7 
Training on Simulator 
 
 
Air India Express has a simulator for Boeing 737-800 aircraft. However this 
simulator suffers from maintenance problem and frequent breakdowns. In view of 
vast requirement of training, the simulator should have a much better state of 
serviceability. 
 
AI Express operates to some of the critical airfields such as Mangalore, 
Calicut and Pune. The simulator should be able to generate synthetic displays of 
these airfields. With availability of enhanced fidelity these days, the flight crew can 
be given better training. 
  
Apart from normal emergencies, emphasis during simulator training should 
also be given to ‘Go Around’ procedure from both stabilised and unstabilised 
approach conditions.  
 
4.1.8 
Co-ordination Meetings 
 
There is a need for frequent co-ordination meetings between various Post 
Holders for smooth operations of the Airline. The departments of operations, flight 
safety, engineering and training need to meet more often, to address various 
interdepartmental issues and to synergise working environment. 
 
4.1.9 
Crew Resource Management (CRM) 
 
 
 
Crew Resource Management training and refreshers for all flight crew should 
be conducted as required by DGCA vide Operations Circular No 2 of 2001 dated 10th 
May 2001 and other circulars in this regard.  
 
This should include both classroom and simulator training.  Workshops to 
include, inter alia, training on assertiveness by First Officers should be conducted.  
Specific issues regarding multi-cultural crew composition should also be covered 
during the CRM training.  Flight crew should be sensitised to implications of nil or 
little communication on the flight deck during cruise phase. Flying supervisors and 
TRE/ TRI should observe all CRM issues including the Trans-Cockpit Authority 
Gradient by occupying Observer’s seat.  This would allow them to assess the 
responses of both Captain and the First Officer, functioning as a team. 
 
In addition, airline should ensure a system whereby relevant details about the 
personal particulars and flying experience of the Captain and First Officer are 
available to each other, before commencing a flight together.  This would help the 
flight crew in establishing a quick rapport.  Flow of such information would be 
possible after computerisation and networking of activities at all bases, from which AI 
Express operates.  
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
120 | 175 
 
4.1.10 
Employment of Foreign Pilots 
 
 
 
There is a need for Air India Express to carry out a detailed check into 
background of Foreign Pilots, prior to issuance of FATA by DGCA.  Emphasis should 
be laid especially on flight safety issues for the entire flying career, as well as 
anomalies during training, if any, from all the previous employers. There is also a 
need to examine medical history of Foreign Pilots in its entirety. The airline should 
conduct pre-employment medical examination for all Foreign Pilots similar to Indian 
pilots.   
 
 
 
While proposing the employment of Foreign Pilots, Air India Express should 
justify such an employment.  Yearly Training Plan and quantifiable targets achieved 
in upgrading Indian pilots to PIC, should accompany such proposal. 
 
 
Air India Express could re-consider terms and conditions of employment of 
foreign pilots. Encouraging foreign pilots to stay in India with families, rather than the 
current practice of serving six weeks followed by a two weeks vacation abroad, is 
considered most desirable. This would enhance ‘ownership’ and a sense of 
belonging amongst the foreign flight crew.  In addition, this would increase effective 
utilisation of these pilots, reduce FDTL issues and need to reacclimatise after their 
vacation.  Further, such longer stay within India would reduce the possibility of 
upsetting crew schedule and the uncertainty, should the foreign pilot not return after 
his vacation.  In turn, it would also reduce the anxiety amongst foreign pilots 
regarding their continued employment and renewal of FATA. 
 
4.1.11 
Crew Scheduling 
 
Computerisation of crew scheduling should be ensured by the airline at the 
earliest in accordance with CAR Section 3, Series ‘C’ Part II (Revised 2009) issued 
by DGCA.  This non-compliance had also been brought out by the DGCA Audit 
carried out from 30th October to 3rd November 2007. 
 
In multi-base operations, adequate number of flight crew (including Standby 
flight crew) should be based permanently at all such bases.  Instead of moving the 
crew repeatedly to other bases, the permanent basing will allow unhindered 
operations of scheduled flights from all bases. 
 
4.1.12 
Pre-flight Medical Check  
 
Air India Express should ensure 100% Pre-flight medical check of all flight 
crew prior to commencement of a flight/ series of flights.  The Operator should 
provide a suitable designated space for conduct of such pre-flight medical 
examination in privacy.  All doctors performing such examination including those 
employed on contract basis should be suitably trained for the same.   
 
 
In addition, a random check for alcohol by use of Breathalyser should be 
conducted by the doctor as required vide CAR, Section-5, Series-F, Part-3, Issue-I 
dated 13th November 2009 issued by DGCA. 
 
Role of Airline Doctors as spelt out in the Handbook on Medical Assessment 
of Civil Flight Crew in India, available on the DGCA website, should be adhered to.  
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
121 | 175 
 
 
 
The airline should encourage short-duration training in Aviation Medicine for 
all doctors.  This will aid in early recognition of fatigue and importance of rendering 
correct advice regarding flying with minor sickness including with medication. 
 
4.1.13 
Aviation Medicine Specialist 
 
Airline should consider employing a full-time Specialist in Aviation Medicine.  
Such specialist should conduct initial and refresher training of flight crew and cabin 
crew in   sleep physiology, circadian disruptions and methods to reduce effects of 
fatigue (including controlled rest in seat and use of prescription medication for sleep 
induction and alertness enhancement).  This specialist may, in addition, be utilised to 
conduct regular classes in Aviation Medicine including Hypoxia, Spatial 
Disorientation and Aviation Psychology. In addition, such a specialist should be 
utilised to counsel the flight crew on their regular licensing medical examination and 
measures to be adopted to increase wellness and thereby a full and healthy flying 
career. 
 
 
 
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
122 | 175 
 
4.2 
For Airports Authority of India (AAI) 
 
4.2.1 
SOP on Watch Hours 
 
There is a need for AAI to bring out SOP on actions to be completed prior to 
opening the ‘Watch Hours’ at all airports.  The procedure should clearly bring out 
various activities which need to be completed prior to declaring an airfield 
‘operational’ viz timely manning of Air Traffic Control Tower after having carried out 
inspection of runway, communications and other facilities including readiness of 
crash and fire tenders.  
 
It is recommended that after completion of inspection, the ATC Tower 
Controller takes his position at least 30 minutes prior to opening of watch hours. 
   
4.2.2 
Avoidance of Downward Slope in the Overshoot Area Particularly on 
Table Top Runways 
 
 
As per worldwide data published by ICAO, most of the accidents occur during 
landing and take-off phases, with a large number of runway excursions and aircraft 
overrunning into the Overshoot Area. Considering the large momentum of these 
aircraft, a downward slope in the overrun area can worsen the outcome. It is 
therefore recommended that such downward slopes as obtaining in Mangalore, be 
brought to the same level of the runway surface. This also needs to be ensured at all 
table top airports in the country. 
 
4.2.3 
Need for Frangible Structures on the Overshoot Areas 
 
It is mandatory for all structures protruding above the Runway Safety Areas, 
to be frangible. These would include approach lights in the overshoot and 
undershoot area, signage, ILS Localiser Antenna mountings etc to name a few. At 
Mangalore, the ILS Localiser Antenna is mounted on a concrete structure. Although, 
this structure is in-frangible, as recommended at Para 4.2.2 above, once the 
downward slope of overshoot area for R/W 24 is brought to the same level of the 
runway surface, this concrete structure will also get embedded in the ground.      
 
4.2.4 
Maintenance of RESA 
 
Maintenance of RESA at Mangalore needs improvement. There were not only 
a number of shrubs growing all over, but some of the Approach Lights had their 
concrete mountings jutting out above the surface. Requisite refilling of sand and its 
periodic maintenance needs to be ensured.  
 
4.2.5 
EMAS and Soft Ground Arrester Barrier 
 
Considering the large number of runway excursions leading to hull loss 
accidents, ideally an arresting system like the Engineering Material Arresting System 
(EMAS) should be installed on the runway overshoot areas, especially for Table Top 
airports like Mangalore. However, at all other runways, the overshoot areas could 
incorporate a Soft Ground Arresting (SGA) system to retard the exiting aircraft, in 
case the cost of EMAS is not viable. It may be pertinent to mention that such SGA 
are maintained at almost all the Indian Air Force (IAF) airfields with regular ploughing 
and filling of sand, as required. 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
123 | 175 
 
4.2.6 
Installation of Distance to Go Markers (DTGM) 
 
As a visual reference to ascertain the remaining distance, it is recommended 
to install DTGM on runway shoulders. Such DTGM are made out of frangible 
material and are installed at not only all Indian Air Force airfields, but also at a 
number of civil airports abroad.  
 
Since a number of civil air operators also use IAF airfields, use of DTGM 
could help the pilots to ascertain critical distances such as TODA, ASDA etc. if such 
runways do not have standard ICAO markings. In this connection, DGCA had also 
issued a circular in October 1985.    
 
4.2.7 
Location of Air Traffic Control Tower at Mangalore 
   
 
After commissioning of runway 24/06 in 2006, the earlier ATC Tower was not 
found suitable for controlling air and surface movement operations, safely. Hence, a 
temporary ATC Tower had been built near 24 dumbbell.  However, in addition to 
limited space, this location does not offer a clear field of view to the ATC controller, 
especially with commencement of operations from the New Terminal.  
             
It is, therefore, recommended that a new ATC Tower be built at a central 
location. The Tower should have adequate space to accommodate meteorological 
officer to facilitate him to take weather observations from all sides. 
  
4.2.8 
Approach Radar/Area Radar Repeater in the ATC Tower 
 
Ideally, approach Radars should be installed at all airports. However, in view 
of its cost effectiveness, if it is not feasible to install approach radar, a repeater 
display of the Area Radar should be installed in the ATC Tower. This will help in 
enhancing situational awareness of the ATC Tower Controller.  
 
It is, therefore, recommended that repeater display of the Area Radar be 
installed in the ATC Tower of Mangalore airport. 
 
4.2.9 
Preventing Erosion of Strip Width at Mangalore 
 
Due to the constraints of terrain, the Table Top runway 24/06 has a strip width 
of 150 metres instead of standard 300 metres. The limited strip width is also one of 
the permanent concessions being sought by AAI for licensing of airport at 
Mangalore. 
 
In order to ensure that the strip width does not reduce further, there is a need 
to initiate engineering measures. Use of nets and strict control over quarry and 
mining activity in this area are some of the recommended measures. 
 
All Operators should cater to safe crosswind limitation for the type of aircraft 
operations in view of the narrower strip width. The ATC Controller needs to caution 
the pilots in this regard.   
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
124 | 175 
 
4.2.10 
Suitability of RFF Vehicles for the Type of Terrain 
 
Presently, at Mangalore airport, there are two types of RFF vehicles, namely       
‘Agni Shatru’ and ‘Panther’. The newly inducted Panther RFF is bulky in size and it 
can only be used for fire fighting within the periphery of airport. However, it cannot be 
used for similar role outside the periphery of airfield due to narrow and winding 
access roads of this hilly terrain. 
 
It is, therefore, recommended that a mix of small and agile RFF vehicle along 
with heavier RFF vehicle is made available to cater to all types of contingencies. AAI 
should examine the feasibility of introducing Rapid Intervention Vehicle (RIV) at such 
airports. 
 
4.2.11 
Continuity Training of RFF Crew Including Simulators 
 
Due to operational constraints, the RFF crew lack opportunity of practical 
training and crash drill on actual aircraft. On the other hand, recurrent training for all 
activities related to aviation is required to enhance the level of professional skill and 
flight safety. 
 
It is, therefore, recommended that the RFF crew should be sent for training on 
simulators on regular intervals. In this connection, more number of simulators, large 
scale aircraft models and training films should be made available regionally. 
 
4.2.12 
Follow up Action on Obstruction Surveys 
 
In view of increasing construction activity across the country, there is a need 
to carry out obstruction survey more frequently. Other than informing the Operators 
regarding new obstructions, actions such as painting and installing obstruction lights 
should be followed up with urgency.  
 
At Mangalore, AAI needs to liaise with authorities of State Government to 
complete the pending action of painting of water tank and pruning of trees, in the 
vicinity of airport. 
  
4.2.13 
Aerodrome Risk Assessment and Condition of Roads outside the 
Perimeter 
 
Most of the recent accidents indicate that these occur during the landing and 
take-off phases with large number of runway excursions. Since Mangalore is a Table 
Top airport, Risk Assessment and mitigation would indicate that it is necessary to 
build adequate access roads outside the perimeter of Mangalore airport. AAI needs 
to take up the matter with the State Government in this regard.  
 
 
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
125 | 175 
 
4.3 
For the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) 
 
4.3.1 
Post Accident Initial Actions 
 
 
There is a need for the DGCA to designate in co-ordination with Airports 
Authority of India, a post holder at each airport who will be the Single Point of 
Contact in case of an aircraft accident. Such official should initiate immediate actions 
required to facilitate investigation, while the search and rescue operations are still 
underway.  All immediate actions need to be initiated and properly recorded till the 
arrival of Inspector of Accident, who will be appointed by DGCA. It is recommended 
that the initial actions should include video recording of the wreckage for better 
understanding of the situation, while the rescue operations are underway. 
 
 
There is also a need to bring out a Check List enumerating immediate initial 
actions. This Check List should be available at all airports and incorporated on the 
DGCA website.  
 
4.3.2 
Aviation Medicine Specialist in the Initial Team 
 
There is a need for including a Specialist on Aviation Medicine in the initial 
team of DGCA officials, who visit the site of accident, especially in the case of 
fatalities/injuries. 
   
The Aviation Medicine Specialist should liaise with the local Police Authorities 
for implementation of Air Safety Circular No 03/84 issued by DGCA, Govt of India.  
He should also liaise with local Medical Authorities for the post mortem, especially 
those of flying crew.  This will ensure a thorough autopsy including post-mortem X-
rays that can help in corroborating the cause of the accident and establishing the 
cause of injuries/fatalities. Also this Specialist will ensure timely toxicology 
investigation to rule out consumption of alcohol or other drugs.   
 
Aviation Medicine Specialist should also be facilitated to go through personal 
effects of the deceased/injured flight crew and interview their family and colleagues. 
This will help to investigate the possibility of self-medication and any life stress 
events that may have contributed to the cause of the accident. 
 
4.3.3 
Inclusion of Experts of Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS), 
Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) 
 
There is a need to instruct the BDDS, BCAS to send their experts to the crash 
site immediately to investigate the possibilities of any explosive material carried on 
board the aircraft and also to rule out sabotage, if any.   
 
4.3.4 
Revision and Distribution of DGCA Air Safety Circular No 3 of 1984 
 
There is a need to revise the DGCA Air Safety Circular on “Action required by 
Police authorities in case of aircraft accidents” issued to District Police Officials, 
through State Governments. Inclusion of a specific requirement to analyse post 
mortem samples of the flight crew for several common prescription drugs is 
considered essential. 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
126 | 175 
 
There is also a need to widely circulate the revised Circular to all the District 
Police Officials. The official designated as the Single Point of Contact should also 
liaise with the local Police Officials regarding the actions required to be taken by 
them, as per current circulars. 
 
There is a requirement to create a separate link for Aircraft Accident 
Investigation on the DGCA website and to include all relevant circulars and manuals 
on this link.  This will facilitate referral by all officials including Inspector of Accident, 
Airport Directors, Police officers and Doctors. 
 
4.3.5 
Revision of AIC 28 of 1992 FDTL for Flying Crew   
 
 
There is an urgent need to revise the currently used AIC 28 of 1992 regarding 
FDTL of flight crew.  The revised FDTL needs to incorporate issues such as 
clarification on neighbouring countries as well as change in time zones while 
operating on international routes.  There is also a need to incorporate due allowance 
for the effect of flying during Window of Circadian Low (WOCL). 
 
In view of rapid growth of Civil Aviation in the country, there is also a need to 
take a fresh look at the FDTL for Cabin Crew outlined in CAR, Seciton-7, Series-J, 
Part-I.  
 
4.3.6 
Revision of Duty Time Limitation (DTL) for Other Staff Related to 
Aviation 
 
In keeping with the growth of Civil Aviation Sector, there is a need to 
formulate Duty Time Limitations (DTL) and fatigue factor for the following groups of 
personnel:- 
  
a) Air Traffic Controllers 
b) Aircraft Maintenance Engineers  
 
4.3.7 
Implementation of Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) 
 
All operators need to incorporate training on Fatigue Risk Management 
System, which will enable flight crew to understand and manage the aspects of 
fatigue and stress.  
 
4.3.8 
Regulation on Controlled Rest in Seat 
 
In view of the Captain having slept for a prolonged period in his seat during 
this accident, DGCA needs to take a comprehensive view into the aspect of 
Controlled Rest in Seat, especially in a two-man cockpit.  After due analysis, a 
regulation needs to be brought out for its effective implementation. 
 
4.3.9 
Employment of Foreign Pilots 
 
There is a need for both, the Operators and DGCA to carry out a detailed 
check into background of Foreign Pilots, prior to issuance of FATA.  Emphasis 
should be laid especially on flight safety issues for the entire flying career, as well as 
anomalies during training, if any, from all the previous employers. 
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
127 | 175 
 
In addition, there is a need to examine medical history of Foreign Pilots in its 
entirety. All Foreign Pilots also need to undertake medical fitness examination at 
IAM/AF CME, as applicable to the Indian Pilots.  
 
The Foreign Pilots need to be subjected to requisite ground subjects’ 
examination, so as to help them understand the Indian operating conditions, 
including the operators SOP.  At the end of this process, the Foreign Pilots should be 
endorsed with Indian Civil Pilots License. 
 
Although the terms and conditions for employment of Foreign Pilots are best 
left to individual Operators, a longer period of engagement may help the Operators 
as well as the Foreign Pilots, in reducing their current anxiety of renewal of FATA.    
 
While proposing the employment of Foreign Pilots, every Operator should be 
able to justify such an employment. Yearly training plan and quantifiable targets 
achieved in upgrading Indian pilots as PIC, should accompany such a proposal. 
 
4.3.10 
Pre Flight Medical Check 
 
There is a need to re-draft the current CAR Section 5, Series ‘F’ Part III on 
Pre-flight Medical Check, which emphasises only on alcohol consumption. The new 
CAR should incorporate comprehensive instructions based on ‘Hand book on 
Medical Assessment of Civil Flight Crew in India’, available on the DGCA website. 
 
Implementation of pre-flight medical check by Operators needs to be audited 
by DGCA, periodically. 
 
4.3.11 
Flying Checks by the Flight Inspectors of FSD 
 
Flight Inspectors of FSD need to carry out frequent flying checks on sectors 
involving flights to Critical Airfields and also during ‘Red-eye’ flights involving Window 
of Circadian Low. This will help them in ascertaining for themselves, flight crew 
proficiency during such flights. 
 
4.3.12 
Clarification on Flying Procedures 
 
In view of this accident, there is a need for DGCA to bring out a Standard 
Operating Procedure to be followed for the following:- 
 
a) Unstabilised approach and actions to be taken by the First Officer, in case 
the PIC does not initiate a timely ‘Go Around’. 
 
b) Identification of False ILS Glide Slope and procedure to be followed for a 
safe landing.    
 
 
 
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
128 | 175 
 
In view of a number of points raised by Operators and Participants during the 
Public Hearings, DGCA needs to clearly and unambiguously bring out the limits, 
which do not warrant any Operational Incident Reports (OIR) to be raised or punitive 
action to be initiated against the pilot for following incidents: 
 
a) Hard landing. 
  
b) Go Around. 
 
CAR, Section-5, Series ‘F’ Part II, Issue I dated 13th September 1999 needs to 
be amended to remove any ambiguity regarding the exceedence limits. 
 
4.3.13 
Avoidance of Verbal Instructions Towards Reporting of Flight Safety 
Incidents 
 
No verbal instructions should be issued either by the officials of DGCA at New 
Delhi or from Regional Offices of DGCA regarding various limits, which if exceeded, 
warrant either an OIR or punitive action against a pilot by the Operator and/or 
DGCA. 
 
4.3.14 
Applicability of Regulations to Foreign Airlines Operating in India 
 
DGCA needs to ensure applicability of all Indian Regulations to the Foreign 
Airlines operating within Indian airspace.  There is a need to audit their activities 
periodically, while operating in India. 
 
4.3.15 
Safety Management Training for Executives 
 
 
 
In view of rapid growth of aviation in India, both commercial and private, there 
is a need to ensure that various Executives as well as Post Holders undergo 
specialised training in Safety Management. This will enhance the necessary 
awareness amongst senior management, thereby ensuring that requisite importance 
is given to Flight Safety.  In this connection the newly introduced Safety 
Management System (SMS) by DGCA also needs to be implemented by all 
operators.   
 
4.3.16 
Publication of Flight Safety Journal 
 
Since DGCA is a repository of all the current information on Flight Safety, a 
centrally published Journal on matters of Flight Safety will greatly help in spreading 
awareness on safe operations. DGCA has information on periodic initiatives by ICAO 
and has access to data on worldwide accidents/incidents. The recommendations 
from such data can be shared with the operators through this journal. The publication 
could be monthly/bi-monthly and could incorporate a variety of issues which have 
bearing on Flight Safety, such as Meteorology, Aviation Medicine, new ATC 
procedures etc, to name a few. The proposed Flight Safety Journal could also 
include ‘Good Show’ in respect of crew members as well as technical, ATC and all 
other personnel connected with aviation for an ‘individual action’ which might have 
resulted in avoiding an accident/ incident.   
 
Recommendations                                                                    Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore

4.4 
For Ministry of Civil Aviation 
 
4.4.1 
Setting up of Indian Civil Aviation Safety Board 
 
The Court of Inquiry also recommends setting up of an independent Indian 
Civil Aviation Safety Board (ICASB), on the lines of NTSB, USA. This independent 
body will help in focusing on all the flight safety related issues, so as to make timely 
recommendations to DGCA and Ministry of Civil Aviation for speedy implementation. 
The recommended proactive measures will help in minimising accidents and 
incidents. Such an independent organisation is much needed in view of rapid growth 
of aviation in the country including General Aviation.

Investigation and Public Hearings 
 
Initial Investigation 
 
On 22nd May 2010 at about 06:05 hours IST, Boeing 737-800 aircraft VT-AXV 
operated by Air India Express, a brand name of M/s Air India Charters Ltd; was 
operating a schedule QTA flight IX-812 from Dubai to Mangalore. This aircraft met 
with an accident during landing on Runway 24 at Mangalore airport. During landing, 
the aircraft overshot Runway 24, impacted with the ILS Localizer structure and fell 
downhill into a gorge. In the resultant impact and fire, 152 passengers and all 06 
crew members onboard the aircraft lost their lives. There were 08 survivors. 
  
DGCA, New Delhi was informed telephonically about this accident at about 
06:15 hours IST. While the DGCA himself along with other officials from Delhi office 
visited the crash site on the same day, officials from Regional Offices of DGCA from 
Mumbai and Bengaluru were also instructed to reach the site immediately. These 
officials had also reached Mangalore on 22nd May 2010 to assist in Search and 
Rescue work, as well as the Initial Accident Investigation. However, no medical 
specialist visited the crash site till 7th June 2010.   
 
Inspector of Accident 
  
Shri Bir Singh Rai, Director of Air Safety O/o DGCA, New Delhi was later 
appointed as the Inspector of Accident. DGCA had also formed five groups to assist 
the Inspector of Accident and carry out detailed investigation. The following groups 
were formed: 
 
 Structures and System Group 
 Operations Group 
 Engineering Record Examination Group 
 Air Traffic Control Group 
 Flight Recorders Group 
 
The Inspector of Accident had submitted a consolidated report to the Court, 
which included investigation carried out by the above mentioned groups.

The Court of Inquiry 
 
Assembly of the Court of Inquiry 
 
On 3rd June 2010, the Ministry of Civil Aviation vide Notification No 
AV.15013/02/2010-DG announced the formation of Court of Inquiry under the 
Chairmanship of Air Marshal BN Gokhale, former Vice Chief of Air Staff, Indian Air 
Force. The following Assessors were also nominated to assist the Court:

Shri S N Dwivedi, Director of Airworthiness, O/o DGCA, New Delhi was 
nominated as Secretary to the Court.  
 
Visit to NTSB USA for Retrieval of DFDR and CVR Data 
 
Since the DFDR and CVR were found at the crash site in severely damaged 
condition, these were taken to NTSB, Washington D.C. USA, to re-build and retrieve 
the Data. 
 
Simulator Flight To Replicate The Descent and Approach Profile 
 
After having analysed the DFDR and CVR readings, these were correlated 
with the Mangalore ATC Tape transcript. After this, a reconstructed Flight Simulator 
session was carried out on Air India Express Simulator by Captain Ron Nagar along 
with qualified TRE and the Court. The descent was initiated from FL 370 and           
77 DME. It was deduced that with proper descent planning on the Auto-pilot as per 
SOP, the aircraft could have intercepted the correct ILS profile and made a 
successful landing.

Appendix ‘D’ 
 
 
Accident Aircraft Performance Report by M/s Boeing 
 
 
Item No 1. Stabilized approach assessment (glide slope, localizer, airspeed, 
descent rate, configuration etc.) 
 
The Boeing Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM), Attachment 1, includes 
Stabilized Approach Recommendations. The attached Figures 1 and 2 show time-
history data, from approximately 1000 feet above field elevation (AFE), through 
touchdown and a portion of the rollout. Figures 3-5 show similar data versus 
longitudinal distance from the Runway 24 threshold. 
 
Since the conditions at the time of the event were reportedly Visual 
Meteorological Conditions (VMC), the FCTM recommendation is that the approach 
be stabilized by 500 feet AFE and continue to be stabilized through touchdown. The 
FCTM states that an approach is considered stabilized when all of the listed criteria 
are met. 
 
The first criterion is "the airplane is on the correct flight path." As can be 
seen in Figure 3, the airplane was never on a 3 degree flight path during final 
approach. In order to be on a 3 degree flight path, the airplane should have crossed 
the final approach fix (FAF) at 2200 feet geometric altitude (airplane’s true altitude 
above mean sea level (MSL)) but instead crossed at approximately 4475 feet, as can 
be seen in Figure 6. 
 
The second criterion is "only small changes in heading and pitch are 
required to maintain the correct flight path." Figures 1 and 3 show a significant 
change in pitch during final approach. At 500 feet AFE, the pitch attitude was -6 
degrees and increased to +2 degrees at touchdown. During a stabilized approach at 
Flaps 40, the nominal pitch attitude is -0.5 degrees at 500 feet AFE, per the 737NG 
Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM). 
 
The third criterion is "the airplane speed is not more than VREF + 20 knots 
indicated airspeed and not less than VREF." For this approach, VREF was 139 
knots. In Figures 1-5, a line is shown that denotes VREF + 20 knots (159 knots). At 
500 feet AFE, the airplane’s computed airspeed was 164 knots and increased to a 
maximum of 166 knots before decreasing to 145 knots at touchdown. This excessive 
airspeed also resulted in flap load relief activation, which retracted the flaps from 40 
to 30 degrees upon exceeding the flaps 40 placard speed (162 knots). 
 
The fourth criterion is "the airplane is in the correct landing configuration." 
Correct landing configuration includes landing gear down, flaps extended and speed 
brakes stowed. Figures 1 and 3 show Speed brakes extended in the air at and below 
500 feet.  
 
 
 
 
 
Appendices                                                                                Aircraft Accident Report, Mangalore    
158 | 175 
 
The fifth criterion is "the airplane's sink rate is no greater than 1000 fpm (feet 
per minute)." Figures 1 and 3 show the airplane's sink rate (labelled ‘Calculated 
Vertical Speed (ft/min)’) was approximately 3300 fpm at 500 feet AFE and it 
remained above 1000 fpm until approximately 60 feet AFE. Numerous Ground 
Proximity Warning System (GPWS) discrete also annunciates during this time, “SINK 
RATE” and “PULL UP” warnings were recorded on both the Cockpit Voice Recorder 
(CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). 
 
The sixth criterion is "thrust setting is appropriate for the airplane 
configuration." Figures 1-5 show that throughout final approach, the thrust setting 
was idle, N1 = 32%. During a stabilized approach at Flaps 40, the nominal thrust 
setting should have been N1 = 64%, per the 737NG FCOM. 
 
The seventh criterion is "all briefings and checklists have been conducted." 
According to the Cockpit Voice Recorder transcript, the approach briefing was 
abbreviated and not conducted in accordance with the FCTM. Portions of the 
Descent and Approach checklists were accomplished, but were not called 
"Complete." The Landing checklist was not conducted in accordance with the FCOM 
procedures. Additionally, the Landing checklist was the only checklist called for by 
the Captain (PF). 
 
The ILS approach criterion states "ILS and GLS approaches should be 
flown within one dot of the glide slope and localizer, or within the expanded localizer 
scale." Figure 2 shows the airplane was within one dot of the localizer all the way 
through the approach, but Figures 1 and 3 shows the airplane was not within one dot 
of a 3-degree glide slope. 
 
The first runway-threshold-crossing criterion reads "as the airplane 
crosses the runway threshold, it should be . . . stabilized on target airspeed to within 
+ 10 knots until arresting descent rate at flare." Thus, the airplane should have been 
crossing the threshold at no more than 10 knots above the target speed (144 knots) 
and at approximately 50 feet AFE. However, Figures 3-6 show the airplane crossed 
the runway threshold at approximately 200 feet AFE and at 164 knots airspeed (20 
knots above target speed). 
 
The second runway-threshold-crossing criterion reads "as the airplane 
crosses the runway threshold, it should be . . . on a stabilized flight path using 
normal manoeuvring." As described above, the airplane was not on a stabilized flight 
path. 
 
The third runway-threshold-crossing criterion reads "as the airplane 
crosses the runway threshold, it should be . . . positioned to make a normal landing 
in the touchdown zone (the first 3000 feet or first third of the runway, whichever is 
less).” The airplane did not touch down within the touchdown zone. For Runway 24, 
the touchdown zone is the first third of the runway (~ 2679 feet). The airplane initially 
touched down approximately 4500 feet from the Runway 24 threshold (Figures 3 and 
5). Thus, the touchdown point was approximately 1800 feet beyond the touchdown 
zone.

As described in the analysis above, many elements of the event approach did 
not satisfy the stabilized approach criteria. The FCTM states that if all of the 
stabilized approach criteria cannot be maintained, an immediate go-around should 
be initiated. 
 
Item No. 2. Touchdown location (relative to the runway 24 approach threshold)  
 
The airplane initially touched down approximately 4500 feet from the Runway 
24 threshold. See Figures 3, 5 and/or 7. 
 
Item No. 3. Airplane stopping performance capability: Given the calculated 
touchdown location, airspeed/ground speed does the airplane have adequate 
stopping performance to come to a complete stop on the improved surface 
available? This LSPS/AFM/QRH assessment should evaluate dry runway 
surface conditions using nominal Boeing deceleration device sequence and 
time schedules (except as noted), ground spoilers deployed, maximum manual 
wheel braking or auto brakes max, detent 2 or maximum reverse thrust 
maintained to a complete stop (unless the thrust transition to reverse idle at 60 
to 30 knots is sufficient to stop the airplane on the improved surface). 
 
The airplane does have adequate stopping performance to come to a 
complete stop on the improved surface available using a dry runway assumption. 
Based on the data from Figure 8 (described in the next paragraph) and the event 
airplane's weight (~143,000 pounds), the airplane could stop in approximately 2400 
feet with the following assumptions: max manual braking, detent reverse thrust, 
Speedbrakes deployed, and reverse thrust maintained until fully stopped. Since the 
airplane's final touchdown point was approximately 5200 feet from the Runway 24 
threshold, the airplane could have come to a complete stop at 7600 feet from the 
threshold (438 feet of runway remaining). 
 
Figure 8 includes two plots showing airplane stopping capability. The upper 
plot assumes no reverse thrust, and the lower plot assumes detent reverse thrust. 
On both the upper and lower plots there are lines for auto brake settings of 1, 2, 3, 
and max along with maximum manual braking. The vertical scale shows the distance 
from touchdown to a complete stop. Transition from touchdown to full braking 
assumes: brake initiation (auto brakes) at touchdown (manual braking is one second 
after touchdown), speed-brake select one second after touchdown, and reverse 
thrust (if applicable) select one second after spoiler select. No flare distance is 
included. 
 
The conditions are labelled in Figure 8 and are meant to reflect the actual 
conditions of the event: Flaps 40, 450 feet pressure altitude, 83° F outside air 
temperature, touchdown speed of VREF40+6 knots and a reported 7 knot tail wind. 
The wind value was conservatively factored by 1.5, so that the calculation assumed 
a 10.5 knot tailwind. This is consistent with the Airplane Flight Manual and FCOM 
calculation method. In addition, all airplane parameters used in the calculation are 
consistent with the databases used to develop the airplane flight manual and 
operational performance data provided in the FCOM.

Item No. 4. Simulation match for the accident approach (trim at flaps 10 or 
earlier, fly the approach to the runway 24 approach threshold and terminate 
the simulation, match engine N1/EPR and airplane configuration changes, 
calculate the control input/control surface increments to the applicable FDR 
parameters required to match the airplane position and attitudes as a function 
of time, plot ALL relevant FDR and PSIM longitudinal and lateral directional 
parameters). 
 
The 737-800 short field package with winglets desktop simulation offers 
flexibility in being able to drive the simulation controls with FDR data and use 
mathematical pilot models to produce the desired airplane state/flight path. The 
simulation is a six degree of freedom non-linear model that has been updated with 
flight data. A mathematical pilot applies inputs to track a specified parameter(s) (e.g. 
pitch) in an attempt to zero the error between the flight data and simulation. 
 
The simulation match was conducted from flaps 10 and terminated upon 
crossing the threshold (Figures 9 and 10). The simulation was driven with the 
recorded stabilizer position, column position, rudder deflection, wheel position, 
speed-brake handle, flap handle position, and throttle resolver angles. Mathematical 
pilot models were also used on column, wheel, and rudder to assist in matching the 
pitch attitude, bank angle, and heading, respectively. The simulation winds were 
driven with KINCON calculated winds. 
 
The resulting simulation data matched the airplane’s recorded flight path very 
well for all longitudinal axis and lateral-directional axis parameters evaluated, 
demonstrating the airplane’s motion was due to the recorded control inputs. 
 
Boeing 737 NG Flight Crew Training Manual 
 
When conducting an instrument approach from the holding pattern, continue 
on the same pattern as holding, extend flaps to 5 on the outbound track parallel to 
final approach course. Turn inbound on the procedure turn heading. This type of 
approach is also referred to as a race track approach. 
 
Procedure Turn 
Procedure Turn 
On most approaches the procedure turn must be completed within specified 
limits, such as within 10 NM of the procedure turn fix or beacon. The FMC depicted 
procedure turn, or holding pattern in lieu of procedure turn, complies with airspace 
limits. The published procedure turn altitudes are normally minimum altitudes. The 
FMC constructs the procedure turn path based upon predicted winds, 170 knot 
airspeed and the “excursion” distance in the Nav database for the procedure. Adjust 
time outbound for airspeed, wind effects, and location of the procedure turn fix. If the 
procedure turn fix is crossed at an excessively high ground speed, the procedure 
turn protected airspace may be exceeded. The procedure turn should be monitored 
using the map to assure the airplane remains within protected airspace.

Stabilized Approach Recommendations 
 
Maintaining a stable speed, descent rate, and vertical/lateral flight path in 
landing configuration is commonly referred to as the stabilized approach concept. 
Any significant deviation from planned flight path, airspeed, or descent rate should 
be announced. The decision to execute a go-around is no indication of poor 
performance. 
 
Note: Do not attempt to land from an unstable approach. 
 
Recommended Elements of a Stabilized Approach 
 
The following recommendations are consistent with criteria developed by the 
Flight Safety Foundation. 
 
All approaches should be stabilized by 1,000 feet AFE in instrument 
meteorological conditions (IMC) and by 500 feet AFE in visual meteorological 
conditions (VMC). An approach is considered stabilized when all of the following 
criteria are met: 
 
 The airplane is on the correct flight path 
 Only small changes in heading and pitch are required to maintain the 
correct flight path 
 The airplane speed is not more than VREF + 20 knots indicated airspeed 
and not less than VREF 
 The airplane is in the correct landing configuration 
 Sink rate is no greater than 1,000 fpm; if an approach requires a sink rate 
greater than 1,000 fpm, a special briefing should be conducted  
 Thrust setting is appropriate for the airplane configuration 
 All briefings and checklists have been conducted.  
 
Specific types of approaches are stabilized if they also fulfil the following: 
 
 ILS and GLS approaches should be flown within one dot of the glide slope 
and localizer, or within the expanded localizer scale 
 During a circling approach, wings should be level on final when the 
airplane reaches 300 feet AFE. 
 
Unique approach procedures or abnormal conditions requiring a deviation from 
the above elements of a stabilized approach require a special briefing. 
 
Note: An approach that becomes un-stabilized below 1,000 feet AFE in IMC or 
below 500 feet AFE in VMC requires an immediate go-around. 
 
These conditions should be maintained throughout the rest of the approach for 
it to be considered a stabilized approach. If the above criteria cannot be established 
and maintained at and below 500 feet AFE, initiate a go-around.

At 100 feet HAT for all visual approaches, the airplane should be positioned 
so the flight deck is within, and tracking to remain within, the lateral confines of the 
runway edges extended. 
 
As the airplane crosses the runway threshold it should be: 
 
 Stabilized on target airspeed to within + 10 knots until arresting descent 
rate at flare 
 On a stabilized flight path using normal manoeuvring 
 Positioned to make a normal landing in the touchdown zone (the first 
3,000 feet or first third of the runway, whichever is less). 
 
Initiate a go-around if the above criteria cannot be maintained. 
 
Manoeuvring (including runway changes and circling) 
 
When manoeuvring below 500 feet, be cautious of the following: 
 
 Descent rate change to acquire glide path 
 Lateral displacement from the runway centreline 
 Tailwind or crosswind components 
 Runway length available. 
 
Mandatory Missed Approach 
 
On all instrument approaches, where suitable visual reference has not been 
established and maintained, execute an immediate missed approach when: 
 
 A navigation radio or flight instrument failure occurs which affects the 
ability to safely complete the approach 
 The navigation instruments show significant disagreement 
 On ILS or GLS final approach and either the localizer or the glide slope 
indicator shows full deflection

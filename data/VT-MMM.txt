SUMMARY

The Chief Flight Instructor, YashAir Ltd authorized the Commercial Pilot
License holder to do Circuits and Landings. He took his friend Student
Trainee pilot on board with the permission of CFI. He carried out five
circuits and during the Sixth circuit they did not report on downwind.
Thereafter the Flying Instiute received a call stating the aircraft has met
with an accident. The aircraft at the end of crosswind leg deviated to right

and went over the Shipra river. The PIC carried out low flying over the
Shipra River and went in to the electric cable and crashed in dry river bed.
The aircrafi immediately caught fire and both the occupant died due to
severe burn injury.

1. FACTUAL INFORMATION.
1.1 History of flight

The PIC was authorized by the Chief Flying Instructor for carrying
out PIC flying at academy. He was authorized by CFI to carryout circuit
and landing for the duration of one hour. The circuit and landing is a
pattern normally associated with training of the student pilot. The PIC
already had approximately 271:40 hrs of flying experience with valid
license and medical. The PIC took briefing before the flight as per CFI.
The daily inspection was carried out by AME and the aircraft was
released for flight. The fuel on board was 90 litres. The both LEI and RH
tanks were topped up 45 litres each.

The PIC took another trainee pilot of the flying institution for the
flight after the authorization from C¥I for joy ride. The aircraft Cessna
152, VT-MMM took off at 1010 UTC for one hour of circuit and
landing. The runway in use was 31 due to the wind conditions. The
aircraft carried out 5 circuits and landings in course of 50 mimutes. The
fuel consumed was approx 31 litres considering consumption at 38
litres/hr. The fuel on board during the 6" circuit would be approximately
58 litres. The R/T was conducted by another pilot from the aircraft VJ-
EEE on ground.

During the 6" circuit the PIC turned left and thereafter was advised to
teport left downwind. The aircraft did not turn to the left to downwind
but went further turned approx 30 degree left and was on the river
Shipra. He continued over Shipra and came down to approximate height
of 200 to 150 ft over the river bed. The crash site is approximately 3.9
Km away from the airstrip.

There was no R/T call from the aircraft after the previous call of
turning left. The pilot handling R/T tried to raise the aircraft to know
position around 1110 Z. In mean time the phone cal] was received by the

TBO for the same is 2000 hrs/12 years. Though the life was in terms of hrs
was lefi the reason for the removal is not documented.

This aircraft has approximately 12:25 hrs of flying in last one month
and approx 02:40 hrs in last 24 hours. This indicates that the aircraft was
serviceable however it was used sparingly.

The DI was carried out by AME for VT-MMM on 19/05/2010 at 0615 hrs
during the inspection the aircraft was refuelled 45 litres in left and 45 litres
in right tank ‘respectively.

1.7 Meteorological information:

The MET SPECI of Indore Airport for the relevant time under examination
are as mention below;

Observation report of 1000Z
Winds 340/12 kts

Vis 6 KM

Temp 42 Centigrade

QNH 1004


Clouds SCT 10,000 ft, BEN 25,000 ft
Observation report of 11007

Winds 270/15 Kts

Vis 6 KM

Temp 42 Centigrade

QNH 1004

Clouds SCT 10,000Ft, BKN 25,000 Ft

The above observation could be used to approximately estimate the
prevailing weather condition at Ujjain airfield. There is no procedure of
geiting the weather and maintaining the record at M/s Yash Air faciliry.

1.8 Aids to navigation:

The aircraft VHF R/F was used to communicate the position to the
Stationary aircraft in the dispersal of M/s Yashair flying institute. The on
board GPS is extensively used for navigation purpose. The trainee pilots
during flying report their position to the stationary aircraft in circuit pattern.
The R/T controls and coordinate aircrafts flying simuitaneously is done by
pilot in stationary aircraft,

1.9 Communications:

The aircraft VHF set was only the means of communication and the
Stationary aircraft VHF. It was used to coordinate between the various
aircraft flying in the circuit and maintain separation.

1.10 Aerodrome information:

The Ujjain Airfield information is as follows;

Elevation : 1650 ft

RWY length : 3000 ft

Frequency : Communication — 123.80 MHz
Navigation Aid — : VOR: 116.70MHZz(IID) 011/23 NM ID
Navigation Aid — - ADF: 335 KHz(ID) 0! 1/23 NM ID

The Runway is black tarmac type with 13/31 orientation; it has no marking
except centerline as per the ICAO standard recommended practices. There
no coordination procedure between ATC, Indore and aerodrome Ujjain.

The tower is available but it is in dilapidated condition now and abandoned,
In present state it is dangerous to use for controlling and coordinating
operation.

1.11 Wreckage and impact information:

The wreckage was found to have accumulated at one place. There by giving
an indication that the forward speed before impacting the ground was
insignificant. The complete wreckage could be seen in 25 Ft X 25 Ft area on
the river bed of Shipra River, Kalyanpura.

The wreckage was concentrated in 5 distinct portions in the above
mentioned area as shown in the sketch. The portions are designated as areas
as follows;

Area | : Engine wreckage

Area 2: Fuselage & cockpit wreckage

Area 3 : Wing(RH) wreckage

Area 4 + Wing(LH) wreckage

Area 5 : Empennage wreckage

The aircraft had taken-off from RWY 31 and there after took a left turn by
90 deg to the runway to join cross wind. The trainee pilot took the aircraft
for a longer cross wind leg and turned to left by approx 30 deg left on the
downwind over the Shipra river. The aircraft was perilously low on height at
the time of impact with high tension electrical wires. The aircraft must have
been flying at heading approx 340 to be aligned with the river. The aircraft
must be flying then at approximate 150 Ft over the river bed. The forward
speed of aircraft was low and the propeller did not shown signature of
engine being on power when the aircraft hit the ground.

Spinner mark exhibit low power impact on nose with river bed

The propeller has the marks of electric cable on the leading edge and the
spinner. The rubbing marks pattern indicates that the propeller was on power
at the time of impact with the electric cable. The nose landing gear strut is
also having a rubbing mark of the electric cable thereby peeling the white
paint coating on the frontal surface.

The main landing gear struts also has the rubbing marks on the frontal
surface. The RH wing has a cut of approx 60 degree indicating the bank of
tight after hitting the first cable. The second cable must have cut the wing
RH leading edge.


The electric cable sliced the RH leading edge of the wing

Thereafter the aircraft completely got entangled and toppled and fell on the
river bed opposite to the direction of flight. The propeller had completely
stopped by the time aircraft hit the second cable. The aircraft fell 10 — 12 ft
ahead of the path of second cable. The cable pieces found on the site of
accident indicate that few of the strands broken got completely got
compressed appearing like collection of rings woven in wire.

The aircraft caught fire immediately after falling and impact due to fuel lines
breaking at the carburetor end. The fuel falling on the hot zone immediately
engulfed the portion containing fuel like wings and the engine. The both
occupants were alive however could not come out of the aircraft. The both
pilot and copilot seat structural frame did not show any deformation due to
vertical impact.

The both RH and LH wing portions housing the fuel tanks were seen
completely destroyed due to the fire. The wing fuel tanks showed the signs
of small explosion due to high temperature which is normal in case of fire.

The wreckage sketch along with the observation is attached in annexure for
reference. The damage assessment of this wreckage and the item of
component/components is distinctly exhibiting high temperature as the most
of the aluminum items found melted. As per the video recording provided by
the district administration the District Magistrate along with police personne]
had reached the site when the aircraft was still burning. These are an
indication that the volume of fuel in aircraft was very high. There was no
firefighting which could reach to the site due to terrain. The villagers and
volunteers were seen throwing sand and water however the same was not
enough to douse the fire. The officials from M/s Yashair were also available
at that time. ,

1.12 Medical and pathological Information:

The postmortem of both the pilot and copilot was carried out at District
hospital, Ujjain. The postmortem of Pilot and copilot revealed that they died
due to cardio respiratory failure as a result of extensive burn of the body.
The burn could be due to aircraft crash.

The total burn areas of the bodies were 100% and the degree of burn was 5”
to 6” degree burn. The bodies were completely charred with gross
destruction of tissue, muscles, bones etc.

1.13 Fire:

The beginning or initiation of the fire was the impact on ground. This could
be said with good degree of certainty because the electric cable of 33K V was
inspected and did not reveal any fire traces. The fire was confined to the
aircraft and the 1IK'V cable which was found along the wreckage.


The fire initially began on impact with ground due to the breaking of
carburetor and the AVGAS getting sprayed on to the hot section of the
engine. The carburetor is at the bottom of the engine and just ahead of the
exhaust manifold. The exhaust manifold is hot and any fuel or fuel vapour
on to it can cause immediate fire. This has caused the complete engine to
catch fire. Hence the complete engine cowling melted. This fire had spread
to the wing tanks situated right above the cockpit and engulfed the whole
cockpit. There was no indication of inflight fire as no trail of fire or fuel
could be observed on the rear of the fuselage.

1.14 Survival aspects:

The crash was not survivable due to the instant fire and impact. Due to the
momentary disorientation during the crash and in all probability the aircraft
upside down, there was little opportunity for the pilots te come out of the
aircraft.

1.15 Tests and research:

RH side hence no 1 & 3 cylinder had discoloration due to high temperature.
The paint was seen peeled off due to hi gh temperature. The flange end of the
crank shaft which is attached to the spinner with 6 bolts, on inspection it was
found to be bent opposite to the direction of blade rotation. The bent was
slight indication that the engine was on power but definitely not high enough
to bend it significantly. The flange had also bend on one side indicating the
bending of the propeller blade due to impact.

The CFI stated that on afternoon of 19/05/2010 he authorized PIC, CPL
holder to carry out his PIC flying. He was directed to carryout circuit
and landing on Cessna-152, VT-MMM for the duration of 01 hr. The
PIC had approx 260 hrs of flying experience. The PIC requested his
friend Student Trainee pilot on board with him. CFI, after giving
necessary instruction authorized and cleared to undertake the flight.

The first takeoff was at 15:40 IST for series of circuit and Janding for
duration of 01 hr. The runway in use was 31; weather was fine with
westerly winds. Capt Shashank Ajnadkar was doing ground R/T duty
on aircraft VT-EEE.

He carried out 5 circuits and landing in course of 00:50 hrs on sixth
circuit, he reported turning left and thereafter he was advised to report
left downwind. There was no call from the aircraft after previous call of
turning left. Capt Shashank tried on R/T to know his position around
16:40 IST and he reported to CFT. He in mean time received a call that
the aircraft had crashed and was burning with both occupants on board.

On being queried as on what capacity PIC was authorized by CFI to
carry his friend he stated that he under the privileges of his license
authorized him to carry his friend. CFI further stated that the student
trainee pilot had gone on board in the capacity of passenger for Joyride.

The PIC was issued license on 18/09/2009 with validity of 5 years. The
medical was valid till 15/06/2010. As per personal flying logbook the
entry made was on 03/08/2009 was of completion of 200 hrs making
him eligible to appy for CPL. Subsequently, the entries made are from
1/3/2010 in dossier. This indicates that no flying was done by PIC for
approx 7 months. The entries made from 02/05/2010 till 17/05/2010 are
with the remark of AFIR pattern and he had accumulated 09 hrs of
AFIR training. This indicates that the PIC was accumulating hours for
his AFIR rating. He had flown total 71:25 hrs at Yashair after his CPL.
On the day ef accident he was authorized by CFI to carryout circuits
and landings. The carriage of Trainee Pilot entry is not on authorization
book hence carrying out circuit and landing with ‘stiident _pilot seem
morethan coincidental.” The joyrides are normally given to non-flyers
alid not to the trainee pilots.


Capt Shashank Ajnadkar, Assistant Pilot Instructor stated he was
performing R/T duty and the same concurred with the stated position of
CFL.

The broken cable of 33KV electric line across Shipra river

The eyewitness from the village Kalyanpura stated that every day the
M/s Yashair aircraft fly from the airstrip with trainee pilot. These
aireraft fly over the village. On 19/05/2010 he was in his field adjacent
to Shipra river, at about 16:45 hrs he saw YashAir aircraft coming very
slow. He was unable to hear any engine sound. The aircraft first went
into 33KV electric cable and broke one cable that was approximately
300 to 400 ft away from him. After breaking one cable it went into
11K-V electric cable and broke all three and fell down. The aircraft’s
one wheel broke and other wheel got entangled into the cables. Before
he could reach the spot there, wreckage started emanating smoke and
was in fire. The fire suddenly spread, when villagers attempted to save
the pilots few blasts kept them away. The eyewitness ran away due to
blast when he felt nothing could be done he informed the Narwar Police


ws

Station. He also stated that may times the pilot get the aircraft very low,
At times they go up and down over the river.

The aerial view at the beginning of downwind left hand circuit

This statement was also corroborated with other witnesses and one of
them stated that the pilots fly at times so low that we are under fear of
any possible mishap.

The Assistant Engineer, State Electricity Board stated that the 33KV
electric line had three cables. It is 750 ft long from pole to pole across
the river. One of the cable of 33KV admeasuring 300 ft broke and
wherever it has broken it has formed a lump of rings. Thereafter the
aircraft went into 3 electric cable of 11KV, which was 1050 long
from pole to pole across the river. The aircraft broke this cable into 3
pieces of 450 ft and the aircraft was enmeshed into it. However there
was no electric power in these cables during the accident.


Condition of the 33 KV cable found with wreckage

In view of the above statement and facts it could be stated that the
aircraft was low when it was on crosswind. Further it came low by
reducing the power to fly low over the river. Just before the crash site
two water bodies could be seen and attempt was made by the pilots to
have a closer look of water bodies (Photo).

The crash site just ahead of water bodies in shipra river

The PIC could not see the electric cables as it is difficult to sight the
same in the background and went into it. The aircraft broke first cable,
however since the power was low could not lift the aircraft as the
distance between the two cables was approximately 200 ft. Hence after
impacting with the first cable considerable speed had washed and it
after hitting the second group of cable aircraft just fell down.

The issue is why the PIC was unable to see the cable ahead. The reason
could be in the backdrop of available fact, is that the aircraft was to
climb to 400 ft AGL upwind. Thereafter take a left turn and climb to
1500 f on crosswind leg. The PIC in all probability did not climb to
1500 ft but started a descend on the Shipra river which was not in the
circuit pattern. The crash spot is immediately after the water bodies.
The electricity cables were almost at the beginning of the water bodies.
The PIC must have lost the cable in the background due to attitude and
flight path he followed during his descend over the river as
corroborated by eyewitness statement. Also the cable were not visible
from 1000 ft longitudinally which can be seen from the photograph

taken from ground on 20/04/2611 at approximately same time and
similar weather condition.

Further, the propeller blades do not exhibit the normally expected tell-
tale marking due to impact under power. However it may be noted in
this case the impact is in air with the electricity cable of aluminium. The
propeller blade rotating plane was parallel to the electric cable. Hence
to expect a hit mark on the leading edge of the propeller is unlikely. But
the spinner has exhibited the abrasion due to rubbing of the electric
cable. The aircraft first impacted with the thicker 33 KV cable and
broke approx 300ft causing winding of it on the spinner. Thereafter the
angular momentum left in the blade was further reduced to insignificant
value due to impact with another 3 lines of electric cable of 1IKV.
Hence when the aircraft impacted ground it was a vertical fall as the
forward momentum was completely absorbed by the stretching and
breaking of the cable simultaneously. However the six bolts on the
flange end of crankshaft had exhibited bent on the direction opposite to
the rotation of the propeller.

The reason as to why the propeller blade did not show the impact is also
because the rotational energy absorption must have been gradual due to
winding over spinner and breaking of the clectric cable. This also led to
few cable strands breaking and forming a ring over the unbroken strand.
Thus the propeller must have almost stopped rotating before impact on
the ground. The river bed ground was also sandy hence must have
further aided in minimizing the impact on propeller blades.

Finally, even if it assumed that the engine had failed in air, during the
turning of downwind: Then the easy course would have been to trade
the 1500 ft or less height and fly back in the premises of the airfield as
the aircraft had full fuel and the firefighting services were available in
case of emergency. However he also did not give any distress call. If
the option of making a force landing in the river bed was felt better
option then turning and coming back to airfield, even then at end of left
hand crosswind he must have been around 1500 ft then he should
attempted to land on the straight stretch of dry river bed which was
available immediately. He flew and turned first right aligned with the
river and then chose a spot which was just after efi bend of the river
bed. Further, the 60 deg cut on the RH wing due to cable indicate the
attempt of maneuver to avoid the cable was made. However it was too

late to retrieve aircraft as the MLG struts and NLG oleo exhibits the
rubbing marks of cable thereby indicating that it was entangled
completely.

The aircraft immediately caught fire after crash and engulfed it. When
the fuel tanks started bursting it scared the villager further who could
not give timely help to extinguish fire. The aircraft burnt with both the
occupant on board. Even the district administration could not do much
due to inaccessibility of the site by proper road.

3. CONCLUSIONS:
3.1 Findings:

3.1.1 The last Certificate of Airworthiness inspection was carried out on
30/05/2009 and C of A was valid till 29/05/2010.

3.1.2 The Aeromobile license of VI-MMM submitted was valid upto
31/12/2008. It indicates that the same was lapsed.

3.1.3 The aireraft had 45 liters of fuel each in right and left wing tank
respectively. The total fuel on board was 90 litres.

3.1.4 The DI was carried out on 19/05/2009 by the AME at 06:15 IST.

3.1.5 The CFI on 19/05/2010 authorised PIC, CPL holder to carry out his
PIC flying. However as per the pilots logbook and authorization book, the
PIC was accumulation hours for his AFI rating.

3.1.6 CFI afier giving necessary instruction authorized and cleared PIC to
undertake the flight along with his friend Student Trainee pilot on board for
joyride seems unlikely. As the PIC was getting trained to be Assistant Flight
Instructor, hence the sortie being instructional flight could not be ruled out.

3.1.7 The Deputy QCM approval of the AME has lapsed on 30/04/2010 it
was revalidated for the period of [(ONE) month till 31/05/2010 due to
unavailability of the QCM. However the letter of approval was not available
on 20/05/2010 when the documents were sealed.

3.1.8 The PIC kept aircraft Jow when it tumed left for crosswind. It further
came low by reducing the power after aligning with river to fly low over it.

3.1.9 The aircraft first went into 33KV electric cable and broke one cable
that was approximately 300 to 400 ft away from the eyewitness. After
breaking one cable it went into LIKV electric cable and broke all three and
fell down.

3.1.10 The CPL holder is authorized to carry passenger however neither the
operator nor the aircraft had a valid permit/approval to do so. The academy
had the approval for flying training.

3.1.11 The airstrip do not have standard ICAO marking required for visual
operation.

3.1.12 The standard operating procedure to operate in the control zone is not
establish thereby causing hazard to the air traffic in contro] zone.

3,2 Probable cause of the accident:

The cause of accident was low flying and the contributory factors were 10
monitoring of flying activity and ineffective supervision.

4, SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

4.1 Action deemed fit against CFI as per finding 3.1.5 & 3.1.6

42 Action deemed fit against the DY QCM as per finding 3.1.7

4.3 Action deemed fit against Mis Yash Air 3.1.10 & 34.12

4.4 The Standard Operating Procedure for coordination should be
established between ATC, Indore and Ujjain airfield operations.

4.5 The Runway should have the standard {CAO marking for visual/night

operation.

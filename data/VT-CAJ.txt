wing dropped and the aircraft hit the ground on the left shoulder of the runway at about 1200ft fram
the beginning of the runway 35.

The Accident was informed to OGCA, India and the Investigation was carried out by an inspector
of accident appointed by OGCA order vide letter No. AV.15013/2/2012-AS dated 06.02.2012, in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 71 af Aircraft Rules 1937,

On investigation, it was observed that during the time of landing, the aircraft’s nose attitude
was high. The wrong procedure used for go around had lead the aircraft to stall and resulted the
atcident

1. FACTUAL INFORMATION

1.1 History of the flight:

On 03.02.2012, Authorised AME carried out the daily inspection of the aircraft in accordance
with approved Daily Inspection procedure and found satisfactary. The aircraft uplifted with 200litres of
fuel and 6.8 quarts of oil. Tyre pressure of 34PSi on Nose wheel tyre and 29P5/ on each main wheel
tyre was maintained, The aircraft released for training operations with nil snag.

As per the schedule, the trainee pilot reported for the flight program at 0845 i$T, The trainee
pilot accepted the aircraft with no snag. The trainee pilot carried out walk around / pre flight inspection
and instructor briefed weather (Winds 350/05 kts, Visibility 5 kms) and circuits and landings to him.
With AFI onboard, the trainee pilot performed four circuits and landings checks. He was found fit by AFI
and hence, the trainee pilot was rcleased for the second solo by AFl under the supervision of CFI. During
the time of second solo release, the fuel onboard was around 185litres.

As per the training school procedure, the respective student’s instructor handles RT
communication with the aircraft from ATC facitity. During the time of the second solo flight, the AFI was
handling RT fram ATC facility and gave instructions to the trainee pilot.

Curing the solo flight, first circuit pattern, AFi had observed that the aircraft was on proper glide
path and the safe anding was performed by the trainee pilot. Hence, AFI cleared him for the secand
circuit & tanding with 178litres of fuel onboard, During this second circuit and landing exercise, AFI had
observed that whe the aircraft approached close to runway, the trainee pilot reduced the power and
flared out higher than the normal. After flare out he floated for some distance, while floating, the
aircraft was in higti nose attitude. At that time the trainee pilot was about 1000 ft fram threshold of
Runway 35 and about 25-30 ft above the runway. AFI immediately advised on R/T to open full power,
pitch down and execute a ‘Go Around’. Student performed the go araund by the way of opened full
power & pitch down as instructed by the AFI. However, the trainee pilot observed that the aircraft was
not coming down and at the same time he heard stall waraing horn and the aircraft stalled, as a result
of which the aircraft left wing dropped & the aircraft hit the ground on the left shoulder of the runway
at about 1206ft from the beginning of the runway 35. Upon crash landing, the airbag deployed, there
was no fire on the aircraft and there were no injuries to the trainee pilot or any personnel an ground.
There was no fuel leakage. The trainee pilot came out of the aircraft without any injury.

After the accident, approximately 171 litres of Fuel was removed and approx, ilitre of oil fram
the engine oi! sump were collected fram the aircraft.

During time of eccident, CFI was fiying with the other student in local circuit and landing
exercise,

12.
13.

The trainee pilot started flying training from 05.11.2011 on the aircraft Cessna 1728 at Chimes
Aviation Flight Academy, Dhana, Dist Sagar, Madhya Pradesh.

On 02.02.2012, the trainee pilot was released for first solo by Fl and faund Satisfactory.

The trainee pilot after taken adequate rest reported for duty on 03.02.2012 around 08:451ST.
The trainee pilot undergone secand solo check with AF an 03.02 2012 and as his performance
was faund satisfactory; the student pilot was released for second salo,

Quring the second solo landing, AFt witnessed that the trainee pilot was well on approach and
when the aircraft approached clase to runway, the trainee pilot reduced the bower and flared
out higher than the narmal. After flare out he floated for some distance, while floating, the
aircraft was in high nose attitude with idie power. At that time the trainee pilot was about 1000
ft fram threshold of Runway 35 and about 25-30 ft above the runway, AFI immediately advised
an R/T to open full power, pitch down and execute 3 ‘Go Around’.

Student performed the go around by the way of opened full power & pitch down as instructed
by the AFI. However, the trainee pilot observed that the aircraft was not coming down and at
the same time he heard stall warning horn and the aircraft stalled, as a result of which the
arcratt lett wing dropped & the aircraft hit the ground on the left shoulder of the runway at
about 1200ft trom the beginning of the runway 35.

The AFi, insteueted the trainee pilot to perform Go around maneuver without analyzing the
cockpit environment was hypothetical.

The trainee pilot simply followed instructions provided by the AFI who is autside the cockpit
without analyzing the cockpit configuration.

The trainee pilot wag not able to recognize the stall condition and correct the pitch attitude and
power canfiguration,

The trainee pilat performed Full Power, Nose down and Go Around instructions provided by the
instructor instead ta recover from stall condition by lowering the nase and then applying full
power,

From the FTPR records, it has been observed that the student required additional training for
the stall maneuver recovery,

There was no post flying de-briefing record maintained by the training academy

Prior ta the accident sortie, the trainee pilot carried out one safe landing and no snag was
encountered by him.

From the above it has been observed that when the aircraft was around 25-30 feet above

Bround, the aircraft was floating in the ground effect and the power was reduced to idle. Speed was
already decreasing and the aircraft was In nose high attitude. With the aircraft was floating with high

12

ent tea

attilude, the instructor instructed on the hand heid radio fram ATC Lower to Bo around by applying full
power and nose down, trainee immediately added full power whieh in turn, further increased the nose
attitude which has resulted the aircraft to stall, However, to break the stall, nose down and then apply
sufficient power procedure to be perfarmed. The apposite manoeuvre resulted into power off stall
Situation which finally lead to the crash landing of the aircraft.

2.3. Weather condition

1, The wind condition was predicted by the help of windsack as the instrument meant for this was
not in serviceable condition, The prevailed weather condition was predicted as Visibility of 5 kim
and wind irom 350/08 knots prior to the flight by the use of windsock. This indicates that the
weather is nat a conteibutory factor to this accident.

2.4 Other Aspects:-

1. The runway 35-17 was found with full of pebbles. However, the aircraft tyres were found intact
and were holding pressure. Hence, runway condition was not a contributory factor. Though the
Govt, of Madhya Pradesh is accountable for maintenance of the Airstrip, there is no check and
baiance be ng kept in place by the training school to ensure the Airstrip fitness for regular day to
day operations and the accountable authority was not informed about the discrepancy to carry
out the adequate maintenance work.

2. The Afi is i CPL holder with PIC endorsemen: on C-152, €-172 BR and BE-76 and his AFIR rating
states C-152 airplane on which instructions can be imparted.

3. The €-152 is an analog instrument aircraft which comes under 1500 kdogram weight category,
The C-172R is also under 1500 kilogram weight and is somparatively more advanced glass
cockpit aircraft equipped with Garmin 1000 digital instrument panels.

4. AFL is performing the privileges of Assistant flight instructor rating on C — 1728 as per the
Aircraft Rulas 1937, Privileges of AFIR.

S. AS per the regulations, AFI can release second solo to the trainee pilot under the supervision of
FI/CFI. On that day, CFl was available at station, During time of accident, CHi was flying with the
other student in local circuit and landing exercise,

3. CONCLUSION:-

3,1 Findings:

1. The aircraft had valid C of A& CofR.

2. The aircraft nad all the valid documents required for operation of the aircraft

3. Aircraft was maintained in fully airworthy condition and no Maintenance work was pending
before release for training purpose.

4. After completing the daily inspection and being completely satisfied, the AME had released the
aircraft on 03.02.2012 for training flights with 200 litres of fuel and 6.8 quantity of ail was on
board.

5. MET informetion was obtained from IMO website far the city of Bhopal and AFI predicted Jocal
weather by using wind sock and provided the weather infarmation to the student

&. The trainee pilat was released for 2nd salo after assessing his performance by AFI,

trainee pilot,

During the second landing, the trainee pilot was well on approach, When the aircraft was
around 25-10 feet, the aircraft was floating in the ground effect with nose high altitude and the
power was reduced to idle. As speed was already decreasing due to nose high attitude and no
power in aircraft, resulted stall warning,

As the aircraft was floating the instructor instructed “Full Power, Nose Down, and Go
Around.“As the aircraft had no power and nose high attitude, the trainee pilat added power as
per instructor instructions without analyzing the cockpit environment. Due ta addition of
power with nose high attitude, the nose of aircraft pitched up and stall warning was triggered.
Further the aircraft undergone in power off stall.

The procedure followed to break the stall is "Nose Down-Full Power” whereas, the Assistant
Flight Instructor given the wrong instructions of “Full Power-Nose Down-Ga Around” which was
followed by the student which lead to stalling of the aircraft and teading to left wing dropping
and the aircraft to ceash on the left shoulder of the runway at about 1200ft from the beginning
of the runway 35.

Flight training school was not aware about the post flight medica! checkup of the trainee pilot
immediately after the accident, Hence no post flight medical checkup of the trainee pilot was
carried out.

Aircraft substantially damaged.

After the accident the remaining fuel & ail was removed from the aircraft.

During the inspection after the accident, the runway was found to be full of pebbles. This
depicts that the training school had not informed the Accountable authority responsible for
maintaining the serviceability of Airstrip and ensuring the fitness of runway for regular day to
day operation.

There is no de-briefing record maintained by the Flight school to assess the trainee pilot’s
improvement in performance in handling of ai-craft.

3.2 Probable Cause:

4.

During the time of landing, the aircraft’s nose attitude was high and the wrong go around

procedure adopted by the trainee pilot as directed by the AFI, resulted into the aircraft stall thereby
causing the accicent.

SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Necessary corrective training may be imparted fo the traince pilot.

. Necessary corrective action to be taken against AFI for instructing wrong procedure to the trainee

pilot without properly assessing the situation.

14

3. The training instivule to be instructed 1o carry oul necessary runway surface maintenance/ repair
work and to ensure that the serviceable instruments/ equipments are made available at the ATC
tower, Necessary arrangement to be made to provide Accurate MET information to the students

4 Any other action as deemed fit by the competent authority.

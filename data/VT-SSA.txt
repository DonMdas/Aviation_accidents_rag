1. FACTUAL INFORMATION

1.1 History of flight :

On 3.7.97, F-27-200 aircraft, VT-SSA belonging to M/s
Elbee Airlines arrived at Mumbai at 2055 UTC(of 2.7.97)
after operating cargo flight Delhi-Ahmedabad-Mumbai . It
was scheduled to operate Cargo flight for the sector
Mumbai-Bangalore under the command of Capt. H. Majumdar
with Capt. P. Bulsara as first officer. There was a cargo
load of 4226 Kg on board. The aircraft took-off from R/W
27 of Mumbai airport at 2216 UTC of 2.7.97 (0346 IST of
3.7.97) with reported winds as 110/05 kts. After take-off
the pilot reported to Tower at 221720 UTC (of 2.7.97), “VSA
is turning left Sir, thousand two hundred, we are entering
weather Otherwise” to which tower acknowledged and asked
VT-SSA to contact Radar on 127.9 MHz. At 221755 the
aircraft contacted the Radar on 127.9 MHz. and was asked to
establish radial 146 and report passing flight level 80,
climb level 170 for which aircraft acknowledged at 221809
UTC “Roger, call you establish 146 passing 70, and reaching
170 SA.” This was the last transmission from the aircraft
and after this there was no contact with the aircraft.
After about 3 minutes, Radar gave a call to VT-SSA, but
there was no response. Between 222100 and 222208 UTC, radar
called VT-SSA 4 times, still there was no response. At
222230 UTC, radar called VT-SSC, which had airborne about 2
minutes prior to VI-SSA to get the position of VT-SSA. vT-
ssc after making several attempts to contact VT-SSA
reported to Radar that there was no response from VT-SSA.

Further at 222709 UTC, Radar also requested another
aircraft, CPA750 approaching Mumbai for getting the
position of VT-SSA. At 222742 uTc vrT-ssc reported getting
an ELT signal on 121.5 and the signal was weak. The
aircraft CPA750 also reported at 222808 UTC that they were
receiving weak beacon. However at 222840 wvuTc CPA750
reported getting strong signal on 121.5. VT-SSC which was
asked for search and rescue of VT-SSA reconfirmed at
224140 UTC that the beacon was very strong at 18 miles NW
of Bombay. However the trace of aircraft was not
established. ATC issued an alert message and requested the
Coast Guard and Navy to initiate search and rescue

operations.

At about 0600 UTC, Station commander of Airforce
Station Madh island reported on land line that some debris
of the aircraft was sighted on the coast of Madh island.
The debris contained some portion of the floorboard along
with some courier mail. In spite of extensive search
carried out, the main portion of the wreckage has not been
located so far. The aircraft had crashed into the Arabian
Sea off Mumbai coast about 5-7 NM NW from R/W 27 of Mumbai
airport and got destroyed. Bodies of Capt. Majumdar and
Capt. Bulsara were not traceable. However, a piece of
flesh having a portion of the chest and stomach had come
ashore on Mudh Island, which could not be identified as
either that of commander or of the First Officer. Both the
crew members were presumed to be dead. There was no

evidence of fire.

The Satellite picture of 2100 uTC was provided by
IMD, Delhi for the weather over Mumbai. The cloud coverage

over Mumbai airport and neighbouring areas was reported as:

"Broken low/medium clouds embedded with moderate to
intense convective clouds. Cold cloud tops with temperature

ranging between -36°C to -50°C present over the area."

The Radar scope polar observations taken from weather
Radar at Mumbai airport at 2100 UTC indicated two cloud
patches with 4 Kms height at a distance of about 70 kms
towards West and west-south-west of Mumbai. Observations
at 2200 UTC indicate that the patches observed at 2100 UTC
have apparently moved towards east and more cloud patches
were also observed; with a height of 4 Kms at a distance of
70 Kms towards North, with a height of 5 Kms at a distance
of 40 Kms towards north-west, with a height of 5 Kms at a
distance of 35 Kms towards West-South-West, with a height
of 3 Kms at a distance of 40 Kms towards South West.

The observations at 2300 UTC indicated that the cloud
patches have moved nearer to the station and height of 5-6

Kms were observed.

These clouds reported are usually interpreted as low
and medium and the range of 4-6 xXms heights may be
interpreted as cumuliform type of clouds(as per Radar

picture).


1.8 Aids to Navigation
= avigation

The accident occurred about three minutes after the
aircraft had taken off from Mumbai airport. The following

navigational aids were available at the time of accident

DVOR/DME (116.6 MHZ), NDB (265 KHz).

Above navigational facilities were working normal
during the period of accident and entries to this effect
were found made in the log books. The aircraft informed ATC
of taking a left turn to avoid weather and thereafter was
to proceed on VOR radial 146 for its destination Bangalore.
There was no transmission from the aircraft any time after

take off indicating non-availability of the nav-aids.
1.9 Communication
communication

Prior to the accident, the aircraft was in contact
with Mumbai Tower (118.1 MHz) and mumbai Approach (127.9
MHz). During contact with these units the communication to
and from aircraft was normal and there was no report
whatsoever from aircraft about any kind of communication
problem experienced at Mumbai airport. The aircraft was in
contact with Mumbai Approach from time 221755 uTC to 221809

UTC and the transmission from/to the aircraft was normal.
1.10 Aerodrome Information
Senne Anformation

During take off from Mumbai, RWY 27 was used by the
aircraft. The said RWY has a total length of 11,455 ft and
is equipped with ILS ana CAT II lighting system. The runway
lighting were reported to be operating normal during take
off. DVOR and NDB are available as navigational aids at

Mumbai airport.

The airport is managed by AAI (IAD) and has Category
IX fire services to meet the aircraft emergencies
within/vicinity of the aerodrome. After the aircraft had
lost contact with ATC, the safety services were put on

alert by declaring full emergency.

1.11 Flight Recorders
8

The aircraft was fitted with a Fairchild 100 Cockpit
Voice Recorder S/N 51021. It was also fitted with DFDR S/N
2851. These recorders were fitted with under water locator
beacons (ULB) . ULB when immersed in water keeps emitting
acoustic signals for a period of about one month, which can
be picked up by acoustic locator system. Extensive search
was carried in the Arabian Sea off Mumbai coast using
Dukane Underwater Locator System with the help of divers of
coastguard. Due to adverse weather conditions, the
recorders could not be located. Services of National Remote
Sensing Agency were also engaged for probable locations of
the aircraft and its recorders in the sea. Services of
M/s. Sea Swift, a professional company employing divers
were also engaged for location of the recorders as well as
aircraft wreckage. But due to deteriorating weather
conditions during monsoon period, there was no success.
Search was continued for over a month without any success.
So far so the recorders have not been located. The data
from these recorders will be analysed, when the recorders
are retrieved. The details of the search carried out have

been explained in para 1.17.1.
1.12 Wreckage and impact information
— ee pact inrormation

Some pieces of floor board and algo some debris of the
cargo was collected from the Mudh-island beach, which was
washed off after the aircraft crashed into the sea. The
floating debris included one Halon fire extinguisher in a

deformed condition, wing root top rear panel near flap

track ('No Step' printed on this), a small piece of de-
icing boot, out flow valve, air filter and a page of
Airplane Flight Manual ete, BCAS office, Mumbai was
requested to depute experts from BDDS for inspecting/
examining the floating wreckage recovered from the
explosion point of view. The wreckage was examined by
BDDS. The Controller of Explosives, BCAg has intimated that
wreckage was inspected from explosive angle. No traces of
explosives were found, thus ruling out the possibility of

air crash because of explosives, They further intimated

due to inclement weather and rough sea, it could not be

concluded finally as to the reason of crash.

Examination of the recovered wreckage revealed that
the aircraft got destroyed after impact with sea. The main
wreckage has not been located so far inspite of extensive
search carried out by various agencies, the details of
which have been explained in Para 1.17.1. The examination
of the main wreckage shall be carried out as soon as the

Same is located ang recovered.

1.13 Medical and Pathological information
ren ogical information

Both the flight crew were subjected to preflight
medical examination prior to undertaking the flight on
3.7.97 and nothing adverse was detected. Bodies of both
the crew members were not traceable, However, a piece of
flesh, having a portion of chest and stomach had come
ashore on Mudh Island, which could not be identified ag

eS OP Orations

The Navy and Coast Guard authorities continued their search
from 3.7.97 to 5.7.97 but there was no Success. On 6th July
97 Dukane Underwater Acoustic Locator System received from
DGCA (HQ), which could pick up acoustic signals from CVR &
DFDR was used by the divers of the Coast Guard. They were
given demonstration on this equipment before it was used. A
boat was sent out to the sea on 6th and 7° July, 1997 to
the accident area in search of the aircraft. ‘The boat
returned without any success. Since there appeared no
chance of pilots survival in the accident by that time, the

Search and rescue Operation was given up by them and the

take images of the aircraft from the seq bed so as to
recover the aircraft along with cvrR and DFDR. NRSA had
flown their aircraft over the Arabian Sea off Mumbai coast
and carried out Data Interpretation of Aeromagnetic data
and Scanner Data Survey of the accident area for about 10
hrs. It had given probable locations of the aircraft in the
sea with the following co-ordinates in the order of

priority

1. 19deg 05.2405'N and 72deg 47.565’R,

2. 19deg 06.00’ wn and 72deg 46.240'R

Meanwhile negotiations were held by M/s Elbee with M/s
Sea Swift, a professional company employing divers to start
search and to locate the aircraft wreckage from the sea.
M/s Sea Swift started their operation on 8.7.97. The divers
of the company were demonstrated for handling and Operating
the Dukane Underwater Acoustic Locator System. The boat
left Madh Jetty at o0goo IST and was out to sea for
conducting search operation for 8 to 10 hrs but there was
no success. The condition of the sea was extremely bad.
With the monsoon ‘on’, the sea was very rough and the waves
were as high as 20°. Special permission was obtained by
Elbee airlines from the Maritime authorities to send the
boat since from 7t June’97 the fishermen were forbidden by
the Govt. to go to the seq because of the element of risk

involved.

On 9.7.97, Search was carried out on the path of the
aircraft with the help of GPS, the boat left at 0800 Ist
for conducting the Search and returned at 1800 hrs. The sea
was very rough and visibility was very poor and it was
raining very heavily. The areas scanned were from 19°-03°_
612"N, 72°-43'-410"R to 19°-06'-667", 72°-49'-029"R, some

and shallow water accompanied by muddy atmosphere
underneath eluded the success. During the Search strong
signals were reported at full gain at 19°-05'-618°N, 72°-
49’-029”’E and 19°-05’-~660"N, 72°-48'-884¢R.

On 10.7.97, the boat left with divers along with Gps,
the sea was rough, undercurrents were very strong and it
was raining heavily. Some Signals were received and there

were adverse under water conditions. The divers made 6

dives but could not locate the wreckage, Strong signals

were received at 19°-05'-a4q-y, 72°~-49¢-179"]

Gy

During the
dives it was observed that the visibility under water
(below 2-3 feet) was very poor due to black dirty water.

On 11°® anda qgth July also the operations were carried out

the search because of these unstable conditions. The area
scanned were from 19°-047-939¢n, 72°-48'-920"R to 19°-95°~-
696’N, 72°-48'-729¢R. No signals could be picked up.

On 14.7.97, since the sea was slightly calm early in
the morning, the boat left at that time along with Gps and
Dukane Underwater Acoustic Locator system. The search of
some areas resulted in Picking up signals and some buoys
were installed to mark the places, The divers went down 10
times but the reported underwater currents hampered the
search operations. Dukane Underwater Acoustic Locator
System was checked with beacon before each dive. At 19°-
05’~584°N, 72°-49'-096"E, ang 19°-05'-486-n, 72°-49'-139"R
floats were installed as signals were received at these
locations. at 19°-05'-225-n, 72°-48'-333¢R location which
was between the parallel line of rock about 50 ft apart,

strong signals were received and float was installed,

On 15.7.97, the boat left early in the Morning. The
conditions at sea were similar to the previous day and
divers were continuously Giving into the sea but no signals
could be picked up. On 16.7.97, M/s Elbee Airlines, decided
to further augment the operation with the help of another
agency M/s Duke Offshore. on 17.7.97, the divers of the
company were given demonstration of Dukane Underwater
Acoustic Locator System and a boat was sent out into the

sea. The areas were searched from 19°-02'-g06n, 72°-467-

inspite of the efforts made as explained above, the
wreckage has not been located so far. M/s. Elbee Airlines
have been in touch with Fishermen Association and have
offered a reward if any one of them could locate the
wreckage. Further the matter was also taken up with
National Institute of Oceanography, Goa for locating the
wreckage. The evaluation is being done for the capabilities
of National Institute of Oceanography, Goa to make search
for the wreckage on the coastlines near Mudh Island, where
water depth is less. AS and when the wreckage of the
aircraft is located, further investigation would be

conducted.

1.17.2. During investigation it was revealed that Flight
dispatcher approval of Sh. Sunil Khatri had expired on
3.12.96 and thereafter M/s Elbee Airlines failed to obtain
further extension of approval from DGCA Haqrs. The matter
was taken up with M/s Elbee Airlines and they intimated
that since Sh. sunil Khatri was on leave for certain
periods between Dec.'96 to March'97, they forgot to request
DGCA Hqrs. for extension of his approval and they regretted
for their lapse. It is therefore felt that all scheduled
operators while submitting the list of their approved
flight dispatchers to Met. offices at airports, should also
include the validity of their approval so that Met. offices
give the Met. briefing to the authorised flight
dispatchers. All scheduled operators are therefore required
to ensure that their flight dispatchers have valid approval
during performance of their duties. Met. offices should
also ensure that the Met. briefing is given to the

authorised flight dispatchers.

1.17.3 Use of weather radar to assess weather in take off
path

The aircraft is fitted with Bendix Weather Radar.

The primary use of this radar is to aid the pilot in the

avoidance of, rather than the penetration, of

thunderstorms. The Weather radar has got tilt control which

antenna relative to the horizon. The range of antenna
position effected by this control is between -15 and +15
degrees. Just prior to take-off, scanning of the areas of

intended flight by adjusting the tilt control to a tilt-up
position to provide beam clearance of Surrounding

obstructions is possible. In case of any abnormal weather

the most important considerations in the operations of
weather radar. An improper tilt control setting can result

in valuable information not being displayed properly.

It is therefore desirable that in the interest of

Possibility of aircraft entering into severe weather

conditions immediately after take off.

2. ANALYSIS

2.1 Serviceability of the aircraft
ey OF the aircraft

The aircraft held valid c of A and was registered
under Normal category, subdivision "Goods Aircraft". It was
maintained by M/s Elbee Airlines ag per the approved
schedules. All the relevant mandatory modifications on the

airframe and engines were complied with. There was no major

its departure for Bangalore. Scrutiny of the aircraft
documents/records revealed that no snag was carried forward

as on the date of accident.

After the aircraft crashed into the sea, a small
portion of floating wreckage which included Some pieces of
the floor board, some debris of the cargo, a Halon fire
extinguisher in a deformed condition, wing root top rear
Panel near flap track, a small piece of de-icing boot, one
flow valve etc. was recovered from the Mudh-islang beach.
The above recovered wreckage was examined from explosive
angle by BDDS, Mumbai and no trace of explosives were
found, thus ruling out the possibility of the accident
because of explosion from the available evidence of

wreckage,

The main wreckage has not been located so for in spite
of extensive search carried out as explained in para
1.17.1. The examination of main wreckage will be carried
cut as soon ag the same is located. However, the
examination of engineering documentation/records and of

available portion of wreckage does not indicate any

the accident.

2.2 Weather

2.2.1 The aircraft had taken off from R/W 27 at 2216
UTC (of 2.7.97). After one minute and twenty seconds of
take-off, the pilot reported to Tower that "VSA is turning
left Sir, thousand two hundred, we are entering weather
otherwise". The accident had Occurred at about 2219 UTC
(i.e. about three minutes after take-off). The Salient Met.
Observations recorded at 2210 utc and 2240 utc reveals the

following:

In between the above two Met reports, a specie was
also issued at 2233 UTC by Met office indicating the latest
visibility as 2000 meters in feeble rain.

From the above trend it igs evident that between the
above period, the weather was setting around the airport
with visibility reducing from 4000 Mts. to 2000 meters at
2233 UTC in feeble rain. tt had further reduced to 1000
meters at 2240 UTC. There was also a trend in temporary
reduction in visibility to 800 Mts. in moderate shear and

rain.

The local forecast issued for Mumbai and 50 nu around,
which was valid from 2200 UTC(of 2.7.97) to 0600 UTC (of
3.7.97) indicated moderate to severe turbulence and lieing
in CB. The flight forecast, which was valid from 2109 UTC
(OF 2.7.97) to 0400 UTC (of 3.7.97) also, indicated
moderate to severe turbulence and icing in CB. The
Satellite picture of 2100 utc indicates bresence of broken
low/medium clouds embedded with moderate to intense
convective clouds, cold cloud tops with temperature ranging

between -36 deg. to ~-50 deg. present over the area.

The Radar polar diagram of 2100 ute issued by Met.
Office indicates that the weather development had started
with the formation of two cloud patches at about 70 Kms
towards West and west-south-west of Mumbai. These patches
had apparently moved towards east and more cloud patches
were also observed in 2200 UTC polar diagram. At 2300 UTC,

the cloud patches had moved nearer to the station.

21

Capt. ALK. Malhotra, Flight Inspector paca Hgqrs. who
associated with operational aspects of the case has opined
that correlating between Mumbai Radar and Satellite
picture, the weather was obviously in the development
Stage. The top of clouds temperature being -36 deg. to -50
deg., the clouds top could be 25000 ft. to 32000 ft. ang
these clouds were obviously cB clouds which could have had
Severe rains visible moisture and Severe turbulence. He
further opined that it could be Presumed that the weather
developed at its peak in the region as the clouds had
shifted from east to west direction and had accumulated

over Mumbai.

In the log entry made subsequent to the accident, the
Radar Controller, Mumbai ATC had stated the aircraft vVSA
was not identified on Radar neither on airborne nor later
due to presence of clutters all around, specially within 10
NM West to Southeast.

The above evidences indicate that the weather was fast
changing and had started setting over Mumbai from 2200 UTC
onwards with presence of cloud patches in and around the
airport. The weather was prevalent in west and Southwest

direction. Another Elbee Airlines aircraft VT-SSC, which

aircraft and had taken a right turn towards North (for
Delhi), was identified on the Radar. Capt. Malhotra has
opined that it could be assumed that the pilot (VT-SSA) had

observed severe CB development on the left and in order to

He further opined that the aircraft should have climbed
another 800 ft. or so under normal climb speed and the
height of the aircraft at the time of its last contact with
Radar should not have been more than 2000 ft. AS per the
Standard Instrument Departure procedure, the aircraft in

normal circumstances would have initiated a left turn at

22

_ 1700 ft. However, the aircraft was not identified on Radar
after take off due to presence of clutters.

2.2.2 The flight dispatcher of Elbee Airlines (Sh.
Sunil Khatri) had obtained the Met Briefing at 1903 UTC of
2.7.97 for VI-SSA, which Was expected to depart at 2200 UTC
(about three hours later) for Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai
sector against a normal procedure of 1 to 1% hrs. Enroute
weather briefing was ISO/CB/TS, Metars/ Specie and RAREPS

were not available at the time of briefing.

Sh. Khatri has stated that on the night of 2.7.97, he
was required to file flight plans for 3 flights (VT-SSA,
VT-SSB, VT-SSC) departing from Mumbai. vT-ssp was scheduled
to depart at 2000 UTC, VT-SSC at 2200 UTC and VT-SSA at
2200 UTC. He went to Met Office for Met briefing after
_ obtaining apc number from MLU and collected the folders

including that of VT~SSA, which was ready. He has also
- Stated that Met folder was valid from 2100 utc to 0400 UTC

and TAFS had validity from 1800 UTC (2.7.97) to
_ 0300(3.7.97). He has further stated that he obtained 2140
UTC Bombay Metar from Met Office on telephone prior to
departure and orally briefed the crew of flights viT-ssa &
VT-SSC and handed over the Met folder, NAV Logs, NOTAMS.

From the above, it is therefore evident that even
though the estimated time of departure of VT-SSA was
indicated ag 2200 UTC, the briefing was taken at 1903 uTC,
i.e. about 3 hours prior to departure of VT-SSA. Though
the flight dispatcher has stated that the Met folders was

23

eee

1800 UTC(2.7.97) to 0300 (3.7.97) and he obtained 2140 uUTc
_ Bombay Metar from Met office on telephone prior to
departure and Orally briefed the crew, yet the weather at
_ Mumbai and its Surroundings at the time of departure
required frequent updating and informing the concerned

_ flight crew by the flight Operation officer. The records
crew having received the latest weather. It is, therefore,

take Met. briefing as per laid dow procedures. Met.
department should also ensure compliance of the same.
Further, during active monsoon period, the Pilots Operating
flights in the interest of safety should visit the Met.
office at the airports wherever feasible to see the weather
Radar picture which can alert them of the development of
the weather, if any, in the vicinity of the aerodrome and

enroute.

From the foregoing, it therefore appears that the

2.3 Circumstances leading to the accident

The aircraft took-off from R/W 27 of Mumbai airport

_ for Bangalore at 2216 UTC of 2.7.97 (0346 IST of 3.7.97)
under the command of Capt. 4. Majumdar with Capt. Pp,

_ Bulsara as Co-Pilot. After take-off the pilot reported
Tower at 221720 UTC of 2.7.97, “VSA is turning left Sir,
thousand two hundred, we are entering weather Otherwise” to
which tower acknowledged and asked VT-SSA to contact Radar
on 127.9 MHz. at 221755 UTC the aircraft contacted the
Radar on 127.9 and was asked to establish radial 146 and
report passing flight level 80, climb level 170 for which
aircraft acknowledged at 221809 utc “Roger, call you

24

ee

establish 146 passing 70, and reaching 170 SA.” This was
the last transmission from the aircraft and after this

there was no contact with the aircraft.

The aircraft had crashed into the Arabian Sea off
Mumbai coast about 5-7 NM from R/W 27 of Mumbai airport.
The main wreckage of the aircraft including flight
recorders has not been located so for in spite of extensive
search carried out. However a portion of floating wreckage
which consisted mainly of floor board pieces and courier
mail was recovered which had been sighted on coast of Mudh

Island.

It is evident that to avoid weather the aircraft had
taken a left turn at 1200' instead of 1700' as per the
standard Instrument departure procedures. Various
possibilities of the aircraft crashing into the sea under
the above circumstances could be considered. It could have
been that the pilot in the process of trying to avoid the
weather has over-banked the aircraft, which at low speed
(after take-off) has resulted in the stalling and due to
insufficient height was unable to recover and crashed into
the sea. However, in the absence of main wreckage and the
recorders the same can not be substantiated. Another
possibility is that the pilot can get disoriented after
take-off from a well lit-up area, to go over the sea where
there are no lights. This is referred to as flying into a
black hole, which has the effect of disorienting the pilot.
However, considering the experience of the pilot in this
case, the above possibility appears to be remote. According
to Capt. Malhotra, there could be a great possibility that
due to severe gravitational load due to turbulence, the
aircraft lashing could have given way and there could be an
apparent shift in the CG and in the process pilot trying to
control the aircraft must have applied push or pull on the
control which could have further aggravated the

configuration of the aircraft resulted in helping the

25


m™

structured failure of the aircraft. A portion of the
courier mail was also collected which was washed ashore the
Mudh Island. However, since the entire wreckage including
the mail could not be recovered, the possibility of loss of
control due to giving away of the lashing can not be

conclusively proved.

Capt. Malhotra has opined that the weather could have
had severe turbulence/updrafts/downdrafts in which the
aircraft could have lost stability and the pilot could have
got totally disoriented and due to the severe downdrafts,
less of aircraft control could not be ruled out. From the
foregoing, the most probable scenario under the
circumstances appears that there is a possibility of the
aircraft, after taking a left turn, getting into intense
weather and the pilot losing controls at low height while

negotiating the weather.

Absence of any emergency call from the aircraft was
possibly due to both crew remaining occupied to regain the

aircraft control till last moment.

3. CONCLUSIONS:

3.1 Findings

i) The aircraft held valid c of A. and was being maintained
as per approved schedules.

ii) The crew held appropriate licences while undertaking
the flight.

iii) The aircraft arrived at Mumbai at 2055 UTC (of 2.7.97)
after operating cargo flight Delhi-Ahmedabad-Mumbai that
was uneventful and there was no snag reported on these
sectors.

iv) The aircraft was scheduled to depart for Bangalore at

2200 UTC (of 2.7.97). Met. briefing was obtained by Flight

26


dispatcher of Elbee Airlines about 3 hours prior to its
departure for Bangalore.

v) Enroute weather briefing was ISO/CB/TS. Metars/Specie
and Rareps were not available at the time of briefing.

vi) The Flight Dispatcher reportedly obtained, the Metar of
2140 UTC on telephone and orally briefed the crew and
handed over the Met folder, Nav. Logs, Notams etc. before
departure of the aircraft.

vil) Radarscope observations revealed that there was
weather development around Mumbai airport from 2100 UTC
onwards with formation of low and medium cumuliform type of
clouds with height varying from 3-6 Kms height.

viii) After crew change at Mumbai, the aircraft took-off
from RWY 27 at 2216 UTC (of 2.7.97) for operating cargo
flights Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai.

ix} After one minute and twenty seconds after take-off, the
pilot reported to Tower, "VSA is turning left Sir, thousand
two hundred, we are entering weather otherwise", to which
Tower acknowledged and asked VT-SSA to contact Radar.

x) Twenty five seconds thereafter at 221755 UTC, the
aircraft contacted Radar and was asked to establish radial
146 and report passing flight level 80, climb level 170.

xi) At 221809 UTC, the aircraft acknowledged "Radar, call
you establish 146 passing 70, and reaching 170 SA." This
was the last transmission from the aircraft and after this
there was no contact with the aircraft.

xii) The pilot had possibly lost controls just after take
off while negotiating weather by taking left turn at 1200
ft before reaching the required altitude of 1700 ft for
taking the left turn.

xiii) Finding no response after repeated calls to VT-SSA,
Radar requested vVT-SSC (which had airborne for Delhi two
minutes prior to VT-SSA) and CPA 750, which was approaching
Mumbai for getting the position of VT-SSA, but VT-SSA was
not traceable.

xiv) ATC issued alert message and initiated search and

rescue operation through Coast Guard and Navy.

27


xv) At about 0600 uTC of 3.7.97, some debris of the
aircraft, which consists mainly of floorboard pieces and
courier mail, was sighted and recovered on the coast of
Mudh Island.

xvi) The examination of the available portion of wreckage
did not indicate any possibility of explosion.

xvii) Search of the main wreckage of aircraft, the CVR and
DFDR with the help of Underwater Acoustic locator system,
continued for over a month but there was no success due to
roughness of the sea and adverse weather conditions during
monsoon.

xix) Efforts to locate the wreckage afterwards also did not
yield any results. Further investigation will be carried

out after the wreckage is located.

3.2 Probable Cause of the Accident
———_ Ee eee Or he Accident

The pilot possibly lost control when encountered
severe weather conditions soon after take off and crashed
into the sea.

Non-availability of latest weather to the pilot was

the contributory factor.
4. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. All operators to ensure that their flight dispatchers /
flight crew obtain latest Met. briefing prior to departure

of flight as per laid down procedures.

2. All operators may advise their pilots to assess the
weather before take off to avoid the possibility of

entering into severe weather conditions.

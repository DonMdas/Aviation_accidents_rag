0.0. PREVIOUS HISTORY

Delhi ~ Kullu air route has proved to be disastrous for the Civil Aviation for the last 6 -7

years. The present accident is the third major accident on this route. Earlier Punjab

Government Super king air aircraft VT-EUJ met with an accident on 9" July, 1994. The

accident wiped out almost the entire family of Shri Surendra Nath, the then Governor of

Punjab & Himach:| Pradesh. Two years later Archana Airways L-410 aircraft VT-ETC

met with an accident on 11" July, 1996, killing 5 passengers and three crew members.

In the present accicent all the five person on board lost their life,

These accidents ass ime the importance for the fact that all the three accidents took place

at almost the same place under the similar circumstances and in identical weather

conditions . All tle three accidents can be technically termed as CFIT. The similarity

between these accidents is too glaring to be ignored, all the aircraft hit the hill tops ,

which were covered with clouds. This gives a scary feeling that history is repeating at a

very short interval. Both the earlier accidents were investigated by the "Court of Inquiry”

and the reports have been submitted to the Government. A lot of efforts were put by "the
Court" and number of recommendations were made. In spite of the same the third

accident has taken »lace ina short span. This raises serious issues and brings out

that the efforts put in is probably not adequate.
During the investig;

ition of this accident, the work done by the earlier "the Courts" were

given due considezation. Efforts have been made to go to the root cause and to look into

whether our follow: up action was adequate or some hidden cause was left

unattended earlier. It was my view from the beginning that merely stating the cause of


ey

accident as "humar error" will not suffice. Therefore, efforts were directed to probe
further including the adequacy of regulations, the existing systems and facilities and the
implementation of earlier recommendations . Painstaking investigation carried out in the
present case has revealed a wide range of areas which need to be addressed if this route is
to be made safe anc nexus of repeated accidents is to be broken. The investigation report

is, therefore, written keeping this objective in mind.

Besides the Meteorological Reports, the pilot who was flying in same area was
asked about prevailing weather enroute. As per him area beyond Sunder Nagar
was fully covered with clouds. As he was not getting any opening, he diverted

Weather has played a significant role in the accident.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Chandigarh Airport is equipped with VOR/DME, which was serviceable
at the time of accident. Pilot was using the same for position reporting

The only navigational aid available at Kullu is NDB . The same was
Teported to be working normal at the time of accident. However, due to
location of the NDB and the surrounding terrain, the performance of NDB
is not satisfactory. It has poor range with fluctuations in bearings. There
‘is no evidence that aircraft could home on to the same before the accident.

Aircraft was equipped with GPS. Whether Delhi - Kullu - Dethi route
was stored in it or if pilot was making use of the same, could not be
established.

COMMUNICATION

Kullu Airport is equipped with HF and VHF communication. Due to
surrounding terrain, Kullu VHF has very poor range and aircraft come in
contact with Kullu ATC only in the vicinity of Pando. The aircraft was
not in contact with Kullu on VHF R/T. However, aircraft had contacted ;
Kullu on HF R/T at 0755 hrs. to pass its position and ETA. That was the
only contact with Kullu.

There is no direct communication link between Kullu ATC and Delhi FIC,
ATC Chandigarh or Alpha control, Kullu ATC can only contact these
places on normal P&T telephone line. The AFTN link is also not direct
but is through Amritsar, which has to retransmit all messages. This in any
Air Traffic Control System, is not an healthy/acceptable situation.

He-wever, aircraft was in contact with Chandigarh/Alpha control on VHF
R/T almost upto the time of accident.

11 FLIGHT RECORDER

1.411 Super King B 200 aircraft is not fitted with Cockpit Voice Recorder
(CVR) and Flight Data Recorder (FDR). Thus vital analysis of Flight path
based on CVR and FDR could not be made.

1,11.1.2 As per the existing regulations FDR/CVR is not required to be installed on
aircraft having maximum AUW less than 5700 kg. Maximum take-off
weight of Super King Air is 5669 kg. But this aircraft is being extensively
used for VIP/Executive flying under private/non-scheduled category.
Regulations in this regards need to be reviewed. :

1.11.2 R/T communication between aircraft and ATC Units at Delhi, Chandigarh,
Alpka Control and Sarsawa is recorded. However HF communication at
Kuila is not recorded. These recorders use channel No. 1 for generating a
time code. Various communications can be related with the time and
flighy path can be reconstructed to some extent using the same. Transcript
of various channels were obtained/prepared, the salient points observed
from these transcripts are:-

- Before giving start-up to aircraft, pilot was advised of message
from Kullu that VUM landed at Chandigarh due bad weather
enroute Kullu.

- Pilot again asked for start-up after about seven minutes stating
he will take a chance as there is emergency evacuation.

- Aircraft got airborne at 0712 Z.

- Aircraft asked for deviation 5 to 7 miles left of track at 0731 Z
From Chandigarh ATC which was approved.

- Pilot requested and was given descend, firstly to F 105 and
then to 9000 ft.

- Aircraft set course directly to Kullu after 'SP' on a route
crossing 22 miles East of Chandigarh.

- Only transmission with Kullu was on HF at 0755 Z when
aircraft gave its estimate and position as 42 miles from Kullu
and descending to F 90.

- Pilot requested for change over to Kullu at 0758 Z, which was
, approved ‘

1.12 WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION

1.12.1 Accident site is located at GPS Coordinates of Lat. 3] °27 43" N and

Long. 077 ° 05' 03" E near village Thuggi, Distt, Mandi (HLP.). Accident
Site is approx. 21 nm from Kullu at an altitude of 8800' (Approx.)

1.12.2 The accident site was flat area of Approximately 500' x 300' with a slope
of 30°- 40°. Area was free of obstacles like trees etc. The wreckage was
inspected by a team of DGCA Officers. Significant observations are:-

- Aircraft impacted hillock while in climbing attitude with high forward

speed. This resulted in very high impact forces and portion of it got
embedded,

- Due to severity of impact cockpit was completely crushed and
fuselage broke into two pieces.

~ Pilot's seat had detached but was found inside crushed cockpit.

- CCo-pilot's seat was thrown away and was found 40' on LH of fuselage.
Seat mountings was found pulled out alongwith structure.

- ail portion including horizontal stabilizer fin and rudder got separated
from fuselage and was lying on LH side on engine.

~ Pieces of both the wings with flaps and aileron were found scattered in
the area.

- All the landing gears were found separated:
RH landing gear, oleo and wheels were intact.

LH Landing gear had detached from outer cylinder. However both
the wheels and torque links were intact.

Nose landing gear after detaching was thrown away. It was found
35' behind RH Propeller with both wheels burst.

- Piece of wing L.H. edge (Approx. 5’) along with ruptured fuel cell was
found 50' ahead of fuselage.

1.12.3 Attempts to overturn fuselage to examine wreckage underneath were not
successful. Thus ELT, GPWS & GPS could not be traced.

MEDICAL AND PATHALOGICAL INF ‘ORMATION

All the occupants died as a result of accident. The bodies after
identification were subjected to post -mortem at Sub-divisional Hospital at
Sunder Nagar. As DDMS of Civil Aviation was not present at the time of
post-mortem and doctors at Sunder Nagar had no experience of

conducting Post-mortem as requited for Aviation accident, they followed
normal procedure.

As per the Post-mortem report Capt. Ghumman suffered multiple
traumatic and crush injuries with extensive head injury with damage to the
brain, spinal cord, internal and external organs of chest and abdomen and
multiple compound fractures to the skull, vertebral column and limbs.
These caused instantaneous death.

Samples were collected from body of Capt. Ghumman and
histopathological examination was done at IAM, IAF Bangalore. These
did sot reveal any pre-existing disease. No inflammatory
exudation/reaction in the tissues was observed. However, all specimen
showed partial autolysis,

Anatysis of medical records of Capt. Ghumman does not reveal any

sign'ficant medical History. However, there was suspicion of Coronary
Artery disease.

As per Post-mortem report Capt. Silvam suffered multiple, traumatic and
crusii injuries with extensive head injury with damage to the brain, spinal
cord, intemal and external organs of chest and abdomen and multiple
compound fractures of the skull, vertebral column and limbs, which
resulted in his instantaneous death. ;

she-ved partial autolysis,

Anélysis of medical records of Capt. Silvam does not reveal any
sigrificant medical condition.

Injucies suffered by both the pilots are indicative of vety high impact
forces to which they were subjected.

FIRE

There was no in-fli
minor localised fir
reveal any signs o:
spread out on the

ight fire. There was no post-impact fire also other than
eonR.H engine. The wreckage or bodies did not

f fire or soot. Due impact wings disintegrated and fuel
wet ground so it did not trigger or support fire.

SURVIVAL ASPECTS

Accident resulted in very high impact forces, which ruled out any
possibility of survival of Occupants. Any of additional measures like

helmet etc. would have made no difference to the fatal outcome of the
accident.

Accident was not survivable.

AIRCRAFT SERVICEABILITY

The detailed examination of the wreckage was carried out at the site and at Delhi.
All aircraft parts, especially flight control surfaces were accounted for. After

evaluation of evidence and detailed examination of the wreckage, following
inferences were drawn:-

- There was no evidence of either lightning or bird-strike damage.

No evidence of any explosive device having detonated was found. Thus
sabotage is ruled out.

Possibility of accident due to failure/serious problem of power plant, controls
or instrurents was discounted.

- There was no evidence of structural failure or of disintegration of aircraft in
- No evidence of vibration or flutter having set-in during the flight was

Records reveal that no major snag was reported by the pilot prior to or during the
accident flight. It can thus safely be concluded that the aircraft was in airworthy
condition upto the time of accident.

PRE - FLIGHT PREPATIONS

For any successful flight proper pre-flight checks play major role. There are

certain regul story requirements to be followed before any flight. Observations on
the same for accident flight are:-

which were to be notified. Operator never informed ATC about details of

Take-off time was revised three times by Fax by PIC. Finally, aircraft
took off at 0712 Z with Capt. Ghumman in command, Change of PIC was
not intimated to ATC either in writing or on RT.

Endurance was shown as 5 hours on flight plan, which is not correct.
With the amount of fuel on board, aircraft would have 03:45 hrs. to
maximum 04:00 hrs. of endurance.

Giving correct information on flight plan needs no emphasis . ATC require
precise information on flight plan to properly coordinate flight and to
locate aircraft if any mishap takes place . Filing wrong PIC or incorrect
number of passengers is not only misleading but illegal also. Wrong
endurance on flight plan can lead to dangerous situation.

FLIGHT UNDER IFR

As per the flight plan aircraft was to fly on W 35 air-route to Kullu i.e.
Delhi - Sarsawa - Chandigarh - Kullu. Aircraft was to fly at F 160 on
Sarsawa - Kullu Sector. Kullu is an VFR airfield, thus there is no
approved let-down for the same. Operator could not explain what
procedure was to be adopted for descending from F 160 overhead Kullu
for landing on runway which is at an elevation of 3556’.

Operator has no SOP in this regard and nor has worked out aircraft
capability for overhead descent to Kullu. Leaving everything to the
discretion of Pilot who does not appear to be familiar with the procedure .
It would have created dangerous and hazardous situation had aircraft
reached overhead Kullu at F 160.

It is on record that pilots were not aware of frequency of Chandigarh
VOR, which is the main navigational aid on this route, this clearly points
to the fact that neither ATC briefing was taken properly nor route charts
were on board aircraft.

LICENCES OF PILOTS

Capt Ghumman's IR check was to be carried out before 16.12.99. No
recoitls are available either with DGCA or the Operator , that this check
was done. Only record submitted was entries of journey log book of
20.01.2000. It is to be accepted with reservations only that he had valid
Instrument Rating at the time of accident. But he flew IFR flights with

expired IR for more than a month. .

2.2.5.1

IR check of Capt. Selvam was to be carried out before 02.07.2000, which
was not done. At the time of undertaking the accident flight he did not
have valid Instrument Rating.

It is surprising that pilots still insisted on flying IFR with expired IR in
utter violations to the regulations, but it is also true that this has not in any
way contributed to this accident.

ROUTE FAMILIARISATION

,

Section 2, series ‘O', Part-I, Issue IV of CAR lays down minimum
requirements to be complied by Operator engaged in scheduled, non-
scheduled, aerial work, flying training and private flight Operations. Para
6.4 of said section states " The first pilot shall have made two flights either
as first pilot without passengers or as second pilot along the route over
which he is required to fly in conditions permitting visual contact flying
and shall himself have landed and taken off at each of the scheduled
aerodromes on the route ".

DGCA vide Operations' Circular 8 of 1995 has stipulated that pilots before
being permitted to operate as P.I.C. to airports in hilly terrain should be
given additional training. Pilots are to be specifically checked and cleared
on the type of aircraft for each airfield for such operation. In addition
pilots have to maintain recency of flying in hilly areas and should operate
atleast once during the preceding twelve months to such airports.

Records reveal that Capt. Ghumman had not undergone any special
training nor was checked and cleared for operations to Kullu Airport.
Thus regulatory requirements were violated in this regards.

Capt. Ghumman flew three times to Kullu in last two years. Though he
was very experienced pilot and had flown a variety of aircraft but
appsrently was not familier with Delhi - Chandigarh - Kullu route. Pilots
who regularly fly to Kullu follow recommended Chandigarh - Sunder

Nagar - Pondo - Largi - Kullu route. Pilots are checked on this route only. |

Whereas Capt. Ghumman decided to fly on W 35 route.

PRE-FLIGHT BRIEFING

As per the proviso of AIC Co-pilot or approved Flight Despatcher can take
ATC and Weather Briefing for scheduled and non-scheduled operations;
however, it is the responsibility of PIC to get properly briefed before
undertaking flight. For private operations PIC himself is required to take
Me And ATC briefing. For hilly region during the period‘when weather
is usually bad, besides requirements , safety of operations demand that

pilot himself get first hand information about enroute weather and
avai'able facilities.

It is established fact that neither pilot nor co-pilot took Met. Briefing.
Records further reveal that it was office boy who reported for Met.
briefing (and signed briefing register) that too four hours before departure
of flight. Besides being illegal it is dangerous too. It reveals casual and
careless attitude and utter disregard to the regulations.

On Kullu route where weather conditions change so fast., taking Met.
Briefing four hours in advance has no meaning. By the time aircraft took
off from Delhi, validity of Met. Forecast had expired. At that time Kullu
Weather had also become unsuitable for landing.

WEIGHT & TRIM SHEET

Weight and trim sheet was not prepared. Though as per operations
Manual of the Operator same is to be prepared for each flight , weight and
trim sheet has not been submitted to DAW for approval.

As per the requirements if aircraft is in private category weight and trim
sheet is not required to be prepared; however, it is the responsibility of the
pilot to ensure that aircraft is properly loaded and its CG is within limits.

In the present case there is no record of fuel carried on board. However,
as per the statement of AME , 1659 liters of fuel was on board. If same is
accepted, take-off weight of aircraft was slightly less than maximum
permitted, but endurance given in flight plan was incorrect. There was no
efforts on the part of pilots to ensure that take-off and CG was within
limits.

It is regulatory requirement that passenger manifest be prepared and
notified to ATC. Operator did not follow the same. Afier accident bodies
of three passengers were recovered but as per the records of Airport
Authority of India four persons were issued passes to board this flight. It
was also observed that passenger who actually traveled on aircraft were
different and not person on whose name passes were issued. This could
have: serious legal implications.

Mott of the private/non-scheduled operators do not prepare or submit
passenger manifest to ATC. While submitting flight plan invariably
number of person on board is shown as "to be notified", which is never
followed. This ambiguity needs to be removed.

Itis »mply evident that Operator has not established any system to ensure

proper flight planning . Operation was conducted in most haphazard way
with very casual attitude.

ENROUTE WEATHER

As per the proviso of AIP Weather conditions required for flight under
VFR are:-

- Visibility : 5000 mtrs.
- Distance from clouds : 1500 mtrs. horizontally
: 1000ft. vertically

Analysis of weather data clearly brings out that enroute weather was not
suitavle for flights under VFR.

The satellite imagery indicated broken low and medium clouds. As per
the }METAR issued from Kullu, the sky was overcast at 8000 ft.
State-nent of pilot who diverted back to Chandigarh almost at same time
has corroborated these observations.

Eye- vitnesses at the site of accident have reporfted that it was
clou'y/raining and visibility was poor.

it is itus evident that route between Sunder Nagar and Kullu was cloudy
with cop of cloud being at 8000 ft - 10,000 ft. Clouds had enveloped and
obscured hills.

At ihe expected time of landing at Kullu, aircraft would have encountered
more than 10 kts. of tail wind. As per the SOP maximum tail wind

com onent for landing at Kullu is 10kts. Even 10 kts. tail wind would
impose heavy weight penalty.

Thus weather condition at Kullu airfield were not suitable for landing,

FLIC AT PATH

MISSING INPUT DATA

Mosi of input data required to work out exact flight path was not available
or was not accessible.

CVR/FDR

This was one accident in which CVR and FDR would have been
invaluable tool in cause determination. Since there was none,
investigation was greatly handicapped.

The uccident has again brought out the urgent need to have FDR/CVR
insta. led on all aircraft engaged in passenger flying. This would not only
be helpful in investigation but would supplement prevention work.

RADAR CONTROL

In absence of CVR/FDR Radar data would have been of great help to
work sut speed etc. by taking different time frames and position data from
them.

Tho zh aircraft was being monitored by Radar at ‘A’ Control almost upto
the time of accident . Radar data/video recording could not be obtained
frora Airforce.

GPS DATA

Data obtained from GPS could have been very useful in determining the
last rortion of flight path and working out speed etc. However in spite of
best wiforts GPS could not be retrieved from the wreckage.

In vi-w of the same exact sequence of events/exact flight path perhaps can
neve. be known. However, with available inputs/data it is still possible to
reconstruct most probable sequence of the events.

PROS3ABLE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

STANT UP

At C557 Z aircraft asked for start up from Delhi Ground. Capt. Ghumman
was -iformed of message from Kullu ATC about VUM diverting to

Chandigarh due weather. Pitot did not start up. It is on record that pilot
talkd to somebody on his mobile telephone and again asked for start up at

0704 stating there was an emergency evacuation and he would make an
attempt.

Person with whom pilot talked could not be traced and whether he exerted
any pressure would never be known. But how could pilot with the
experience of Captain Ghumman allowed himself to be pressurised. But
chain of accident had started with pilots’ mental block set on " Mission
mus! be completed.”

Aircraft took off at 0712 Z and was changed over to SP (Sarsawa) at 0728
when 36 miles from it at F 170 aircraft took deviation to Jeft and reported
overhead SP at 0738 and set course directly to Kullu from ONOGI. Thus,
pilot deviated from published ATS route to a track which probably he was
not vsed to.

DESCENT CLEARANCE

Aircraft asked for descent from Chandigarh ATC firstly to F 105 and then
to 90. At 0741 Z aircraft reported abeam Chandigarh 22 miles east at F
105. Links of accident chain were completed when pilot descended below
‘Minimum Sector Altitude’ in IMC and Chandigath ATC approved the
same. Both violated established procedures and safety regulations.

Onl; contact with Kullu was on HF at 0755 Z when aircraft was 42 miles
and #90. ETA Kullu was given as 0808 Z . Correlating with available
weather data, it is evident that aircraft must be flying in clouds from this
pois. Aircraft further descended probably to avoid clouds and entered
wroug valley. Eye-witnesses have reported aircraft flying very low, 6500"
- 7500! near Jhuggi village in rain.

Wit hills obscured with clouds, it is not possible to establish whether
pilo: himself saw hills or got GPWS waming. Whatever may be the
reason, he initiated steep climb to gain height for clearing hill top. Given
the steepness of hill side and distance available it was not within
performance capability of aircraft to clear hill top.

At approx. 0802Z aircraft crashed into hill in climbing attitude.

Aircraft was instalied with ELT. After accident it never got activated.
ELT could not be retrieved from wreckage. In earlier accidents under
similar conditions, same observation was made. On impact ELT itself
gets damaged and does not transmit. Very purpose and utility of the same
is d:feated. ELT mounting and location of installation needs to be
revizwed.

PURPOSE OF FLIGHT

Accident flight was shown as ambulance flight in the flight plan. it was
meant to airlift a Belgium tourist from Kullu. Operator has stated that no
money was taken by them for said flight.

DGCA has issued non-scheduled permit No. 3/1992 to Mis. Aerial
Services Pvt. Ltd., Bombay. Aircraft VT-EIE is not endorsed on this
permit. There is utter confusion and contradiction in the documents about
status of this aircraft. This aircraft is shown as operating under non-
schi-duled permit in the Quality Control Manual approved by DAW ,
serv.cing schedules also have accordingly been approved. It is not
understood how this manual could be approved. Similarly, C of A of
aircraft is issued and renewed under ' Passenger Category’. Unless aircraft
4s endorsed on non-scheduled permit this C of A should have been in
private category. Despite contradiction in documents, as aircraft is not
endorsed on non-scheduled permit, it cannot operate under the proviso of
the same.

Aircraft operating under private category are not supposed to carry
passengers for hire and reward. M/s. Thomas Cook engaged Dr. Shaw for
this evacuation and rescue mission on behalf of Euro Insurance. Dr.Shaw
wat paid consolidated amount for air-lifting, providing medical aid etc.
This, it is hard to believe that when Dr. Shaw got hefty sum for this
operation, M/s. Aerial Services have provided aircraft on humanitarian
grounds.

This aircraft was positioned at Delhi whereas Aerial Services have their
headquarter at Bombay. Operator could not clarify for what corporate
purpose these flights were being undertaken. Thus, beyond any

tea: mnable doubts it can be concluded that aircraft was being flown for
hire and reward in violation of the regulations.

REJULATORY CONTROL

Investigation has brought out very painful aspect of operator cutting
corners everywhere and in the process violating rules and regulations, be it
proviso of Operations Manual or statutory instructions. It may be due to
inaitequate supervision/operations control or lack of safety culture or due
ambiguity of responsibilities . It is also true that this is not the only
op2rator who is in this situation, most of the private/non-scheduled
operators are in same boat.

It is not understood why situation should come to this pass that such
violztions are detected only after the accident. Before issuing/renewing,
permit these glaring discrepancies could have easily been detected. This
probably leads to inadequate supervisory control of regulatory authorities
also.

Whereas regulatory authority has issued comprehensive CARs/AIC and
other statutory orders but agency responsible to monitor/implement these
orders is neither identified nor defined. It is left to the better judgement of
the operator to follow the same, which in quite a few cases is lacking. It
is feit that every order/CAR must define person/office/directorate
responsible for implementing/monitoring these orders and ways and
mez:is to do so. Action to be taken for violations be also defined.

FACILITIES AT KULLU AIRPORT AND EN-ROUTE

Thorgh communication and navigational facilities did not contribute to
the <:cident but proper navigational , communication and Meteorological
facilities would probably have averted this accident.

Range of VHF R/T at Kullu is very poor. Effective range is hardly 10 nm.
There is virtually no communication zone between Sunder Nagar and

Pondo when and aircraft is often not in contact with any ATC unit.

Due “0 this inadequate communication facility aircraft taking off from
Kullu will remain on Kullu QNH whereas reciprocal aircraft into Kullu,
would remain on Chandigarh QNH. Therefore, adequate vertical
separation cannot be ensured. Secondly, aircraft flying on Chandigarh
QNIi and not on Kullu QNH, which can vary considerably, will have
incorrect altimeter reading in hilly terrain. This is a flight safety hazard.

Sar-e is the situation with only navigational aid at Kullu. Range of NDB
is avout 10 nm which is of no use because by that time aircraft comes in
visuat contact with airport.

Trarsmitter/Receiver for NDB and VHF communication are installed at
airp»rt which is surrounded by hills. This restricts the range. This point
was deliberated by earlier Court of Inquiries also and it was recommended
tha: VOR should be installed alongwith VHF Tx/Rx on hill top near
airport. Action in this regard is yet to be taken. Once this *

36


we

reco. imendation is implemented VHF range will increase considerably
and navigation to Kullu will become accurate.

2.7.5 There is no direct land line communication between Kullu ATC with
Delhi FIC, Chandigarh ATC and Alpha Control.

2.7.6 Char-digarh - Kullu route falls under the category of airspace where only
flight information service is to be provided. However, Delhi FIS and
aircraft have no two-way communication, thus no fli ight information
service is being provided though required. Chandigarh ATC is handling
these flights without coordinating with FIS. This situation can only be
temedied if Extend Range VHF is installed on this route to have direct
two-way communication with FIS Delhi.

2.7.7 The METARs at Kullu are being issued at hourly intervals. Ag weather in

this area changes fast, the weather information to the operator is not
adeqately updated.

It is common complaint that weather forecast given is normally much

diffe -ent than actual weather en-route. All accidents on this route have
been in bad weather conditions, which points to inadequacy of weather
info1 mation provided on this route. There is an urgent need to upgrade

Sunder Nagar observatory to aviation standards so as to provide latest
weather to pilots on this route.

2.7.9 Unless these safety measures are taken to provide communication,
navigxtional and Meteorological facilities on this route, the operations on

this route should be suspended from 1* April to 15" October being unsafe
in ac verse weather conditions.

2.8 DE* HI - CHANDIGARH - KULLU ROUTE

2.8.1 Designated route from Delhi to Kullu is W 35 via Sarsawa - Chandigarh.
Airc.aft is to fly to Sarsawa on track 011 which is 88 nm from Delhi.
From Sarsawa aircraft follows track 333 for Narayangarh (ONOGI) which
is 27 nm, then to Chandigarh on track 307 for 26 nm. Aircraft flies direct
to Kullu from Chandigarh on track 013 for 75 nm. Width of air-route is
20 n:1. Minimum sector altitude between Delhi - Sarsawa is 2400 ft,
Sars.1wa ~ Narayangarh is 3700 ft., Narayangarh - Charidigarh is 3100 ft
and Sor Chandigarh - Kullu sector is 12600 ft. Upper and lower limits for
IFR fights on Dethi - Chandigarh sector is F 460 and F 75 but for
Chardigarh - Kullu sector is F 460 and F 150.

beca:ise most of the aircraft operating on the route are unpressurised,
which cannot climb to required minimum flight level of F 150. Secondly
Kullu is designated only as VFR airfield. No procedure has been

estal ‘lished, worked out or published for the aircraft to descend from
overhead at F 150 to 3556 ft. for landing in a narrow valley of limited
width. This is besides being time consuming is an hazardous maneouvere
and may exceed performance capability of aircraft.

After the earlier accidents, another route for unpressurised aircraft under
VMC was worked out by the Operators and SOP was issued. As per the
same aircraft follow W 35 upto Chandigarh thereafter fly on track of 006
abea:n Bilaspur for 39 nm, then to Sunder Nagar 15 nm. Sunder Nagar -
Pondo sector is flown on track 043 for 12 nm. From Pondo to abeam
Largi track is 065 and distance of 6 nm. Aircraft then turns on track 340
covering 10 nm for landing at Kullu. Aircraft is at height of 9000 fi. upto
Sunder Nagar, 8000 ft. at Pondo and 6500 ft. at Largi. Entire route is to be
flown in VMC with positive identification of Sunder Nagar - Pondo and
Largi.

Though most of aircraft fly this route but the same has never been
published or incorporated as air route. Thus private and new operators as
well as ATC is not aware of this route. Though this route is considered
safe for VFR flights but is only known to the people by word of mouth
and .,ithout any authenticated documents from ATC or regulatory
authorities. In absence of the same casual operators devise their own route
which may not be safe.

ATC CONTROL

Control Zone of Chandigarh ATC is upto 20 nm on north side. Thus,
lege ly they can exercise air traffic control only upto this.

Local flying area of Chandigarh extends almost upto Pondo. Controlling
autuority for this area is Chandigarh ATC. However, jurisdiction of
controlling authority of local flying area do not extend / apply on
desi,snated air route.

Airfzrce 'Alpha' control was established to monitor defence aircraft and to
intercept enemy aircraft. As far as civil aircraft ate concerned ' Alpha’
contzol is to only monitor these aircraft so that these do not deviate from
desi, :nated route. As per established regulations Alpha control has no air
traflc jurisdiction nor is to provide any air traffic services to civil aircraft.

As per regulations, flight information service is to be provided to all
aircraft on ATS route, outside controlled air space . The distance between
Chandigarh and Kullu is 75 nm leaving aside 20 nm of Chandigarh control
zone and 5 nm of Kullu controlled air space, flight information service is
to be provided on remaining 50 nm of the route.

Fligat Information Centre is located at Delhi. There is no two-way
communication between aircraft and FIC on this route. Thus no Flight
Information Services are being provided in this area,

However in practice , Chandigarh ATC and Alfa control both are
exercising Air Traffic Control on W 35. Descent etc. is being given by
Chandigarh ATC without coordinating with Delhi FIC. It is not known
how this practice of unauthorised jurisdiction started and how come Delhi
ATC did not intervene or objected. Both ATC authorities were evasive on
the issue. However, a wrong and unauthorised procedure followed for a
long period does not legalise it .

If at all Chandigarh ATC was exercising jurisdiction outside its control
zone, they should have coordinated with FIC Delhi. Both the ATC
authorities admit that no coordination procedure has been worked out or
established. The same was adversely commented upon by earlier Court of
Inquiries also but situation remains the same.

In the present accident also Chandigarh ATC exercised Air Traffic Control
outside its controlled zone. It cleared aircratt to descend to 9500 ft. which
is much below published minimum sector altitude. The argument that
pilot asked for descent and they agreed , is not acceptable. No ATCO is
permitted to allow any IFR flight to descend below the minimum sector
altit-de. Minimum published Flight level on this sector of W 35 is 150.
Chandigarh ATC thus exercised illegal jurisdiction and gave incorrect
descent to aircraft below minimum sector altitude which became a
contributory cause to this accident.

The gray areas of ATC jurisdiction and control between Civil and Airforce,
ATC needs to be sorted out immediately. Coordination procedure be
estal:lished, handing-over and taking-over points be worked out. A
mortoring procedure be established to over see its implementation.

Alicrnatively a sub-area control be established which should have
Jurisdiction on northern region .

‘COORDINATION WITH AIRF ‘ORCE

Airforce and Civil Airports provide landing , navigational and ATC
faciiities to each other. In unfortunate event of an accident, the
Investigators require certain information/clarification from organisations
on which he has no direct control or jurisdiction. Procedure to be
followed in such events has not been documented, which causes delay and
unnecessary obstruction to the investigation.

In the present case aircraft was in RT contact with Chandigarh and Alfa
control upto the time of accident. Search and Rescue was also undertaken
by Airforce. Therefore, in the course of investigation it became necessary
to ootain this vital evidence. In the absence of any existing procedure or
con‘act officer, extreme difficulty was faced.

Vat'ous Airforce Stations do not act on direct request from Civil Aviation
Authorities, these have to be routed through Air Headquarters, Airforce
was requested to arrange for tape replay of ATC tapes of Chandigarh, Alfa

Control and Sarsawa., Necessary information/statement from ATCO's was
also requested.

After one month it was informed that Chandigarh tape has been erased;
thus, most vital evidence was lost. Though tapes of Alfa Control and
Sarsawa were handed over but Chandigarh did not agree for replay of
these. Airforce uses tapes of 20 channels and considerable difficulty was
experienced to find suitable replay unit.

Chandigarh SATCO did not agree to replay certain queries regarding vital
action taken by them - like giving descent to the aircraft. They were not
prepared to put any thing in writing.

Vice: Chief of Air Staff, when informed, agreed to take necessary action in
the inatter. Transcript of Chandigarh ATC tape was provided. In absence
of t::pe this can be taken as evidence with reservations only.

Probably same difficulty is being faced by Airforce Court of Inquiries

also. It is, therefore, imperative that procedure for exchange of documents
and evidence in such cases be worked out, documented and circulated to
all concerned. Nodal Officers to coordinate from both sides be
desinated. .

The tack of coordination between Civil Aviation and Airforce was
adversely commented upon by earlier Court of Inquiry. Though it was
recommended by the Court to form a committee to coordinate, same is
not yet implemented.

ROLE OF POLICE

It is the responsibility of Civil Aviation Department to investigate all civil
air accidents and to take necessary preventive action. Rules 68 to 76 of
Indian Aircraft Rules 1937 lays down the procedure to be adopted for such
accicent investigation and defines powers of Inspector of Accidents >
Committee of Inquiry and Court of Inquiry.

As Police authorities were not aware of role they had to play in such
accidents, air safety circular No. 3 of 1984 was issued and was circulated

to Police authorities in all states through Home Ministry. Salient points of
the same are:-

- Inspector of Accidents/investigator-in-Charge shall be the final
‘ authority in all matters;

- Fe will have unrestricted control over the aircraft wreckage and
accident site;

- Police will carry out their functions in coordination with and without
interfering with smooth functioning of Inspector of Accidents;

- Police will initiate action to temove dead bodies, to arrange for
medical aid and to arrange fire fighting;

- Only Inspector of Accidents is authorised to issue instructions to
release bodies of crew;

- Jor offences under Indian Aircraft Rules, the prosecutions are
normally launched with the approval of Government of India.

It is our experience that most of Police officers neither have any
knowledge of such circular nor are aware of actions expected out of them.
Thus due to their actions , instead of being of assistance to investigation
they become hindrance.

In th: present accident though Police reached accident site and removed
dead bodies but some of their actions caused considerable delay to
investigation and resulted in loss of vital evidence. Few of these are:-

- Police registered an FIR under Sections 304A and 336 of IPC, which
deals with causing death by negligence and act endangering life or
cersonal safety of others;

\

41


2ALS

2.11.6

2.12

2121

- Police authorities insisted on having their own investigation and
dealing with the case.

- Bodies of crew were released and handed over without taking
permission from Inspector of Accidents.

- Police tried to stop Inspector of Accidents from taking over certain
evidences like, Instruments, Propellers etc.

- Police demanded charges for guarding wreckage.

- Police guard was removed without any instructions from Inspector of
Accidents.

Before investigation team reached site of accident certain important
documents ;like - Journey Log Book, Pilots' Licences and Log Books,
Flight Plan, Fuel records etc. were removed and taken over by police. The
Superintendent of Police, Mandi was apprised of existing rules and was
requested a number of times to hand-over these documents, which were of
vital evidence. Instead these were handed-over to brother-in-law of Capt.
Ghumman on the pretext that these were his personal property. Thus, a
vital evidence was lost. Bringing the matter to the notice of DGP was of
no avail.

Action of SP Mandi amounts to obstructions of proceedings as defined in
Rule 76. Thus proviso of this rule as read with Annexure-VI be applied
against SP, Mandi for obstructing the investigation.

MA!NTENANCE PRACTICES

Aircraft VT-EIE owned by M/s. Aerial Services Pvt. Ltd. was being
maiatained by M/s. Indamer Company Pvt. Ltd., Bombay. Quality
Cortrol was being exercised from Bombay where all the major checks

were being carried out. Some of the significant observations from the
docaments are:-

Cerificate of Airworthiness of aircraft was wrongly obtained in
"Passenger Category" instead of “Private Category". QCM took no action

to rectify discrepancy and to get Quality Control Manual and C of A
amended.

Seruiny of records reveal that in last four months, prior to accident, only
one snag was reported, which is not realistic. It appears defects/snags
were not being reported/recorded, contrary to instructions on the subject.

Tota! fuel on board aircraft during accident flight could not be verified
from any document as same was not recorded. Fuel and Oil register as
being maintained does not give total fuel on any flight. It needs to be
amended.

Average fuel consumption of this aircraft suddenly jumped to 240

ltrs /nr/engine. Such abnormally high fuel consumption should have
alerted QCM to investigate the same. It appears fuel/oil records were
never scrutinised and were being maintained only to satisfy requirements
of C.AR..

M/s. tndamer Company is maintaining a number of aircraft in Delhi. They
don't have any hangar space. Thus maintenance work is being carried out
in op2n which is not considered in order.

INVESTIGATION PROCESS

Itis an admitted fact and there is no ambiguity in the rules that at the crash
site Inspector of Accidents is the final authority in all matters , same was
reiterated by Air Safety Circular . As he is responsible for rendering final
investigation; therefore, it is imperative that investigation is carried out by
him or under his supervision or with his coordination.

For cuite sometimes it has become the practice that after accident Officers
frore various organisations like, BCAS / AAT/ Police and Operator and
also from different directorates of DGCA rush to accident site and start
their own investigation. Inspector of Accidents has no control over the
team which he is supposed to lead. He remains unaware of evidence
collected, though he is still expected to render final investigation report.

Obvivusly, this is not conducive to proper investigation. Inspector of
Accidents has to be undisputed leader and coordinator of the investigation
tea, Firstly, team members should be of his choice, secondly they

shou id work under his control and guidance. Team members must render
thei report on workdone/evidence collected by them to Inspector of
Acc:dents. All documents/evidence collected must be placed under the
control of Inspector of Accidents.

In ths present accident team of Officers from DGCA worked in
coordination of Inspector of Accidents. However, BCAS sent their

43


2.13.5

2.13.6

representative for Investigation without consent/coordination with
Inspector of Accidents or DGCA, reasons of which are not understood. If
it was to find out suspected sabotage then firstly person concerned was not
qualified for the purpose , secondly he has not touched this aspect in his
report , thirdly Inspector of Accidents are trained to identify if accident
was caused due explosive detonation or due sabotage. In such cases
assistance from experts group is always taken.

In the present case certain evidence were collected, some of these very
important one by various officers of DGCA. These were not passed on to
Inspector of Accidents in time, thus vital information was withheld.

There is an urgent need to issue the statutory orders on composition of
investigation team, collection/control of evidence and conduct of
investigation to be under the supervision , control and guidance of
Inspector of Accidents.


FINDINGS

el

Documents of aircraft were generally in order and aircraft was maintained in
approved manner.

Capt. Ghumman had neither undergone special training nor was cleared for
operations to Kullu. Instrument Rating of co-pilot had expired.

Enroute weather was not suitable for flight conducted under VFR. Cloud top being
3000 - 10.900! and obscuring hills.

Aircraft descended below minimum sector altitude in IMC and ATC Chandigarh
permitted the same.

Aircraft crashe i into hill in climbing attitude.
Accident was s.ot survivable.

There was no ¢vidence of bird hit, explosion or lightning strike. Power plant,
Instrument or controls problem leading to crash were discounted.

Quality Controi by Operator was lax -

Operation was sonducted in haphazard way with casual attitude and no flight
planning. The: 2 were number of discrepancies in ATC flight plan, number of
passengers, aif sraft endurance and pre-flight briefing.

Aircraft was being used for hire and reward in violation of the regulations.
There is lack of operations control and inadequate supervision.

Navigational fe cilities enroute and at Kullu airport are not adequate.

Flight informaiton Service is not being provided on the route as required. There is
confusion an¢ ambiguity about Air Traffic Control on this route.

Coordination tctween Civil and Airforce is non-existent.

Itis not practic.sble to follow W 35 route and land at Kullu. Other route being
followed has 1i.t been published. -

Police authorit. es are not aware of their role in air accidents. Instead of assisting they
interfere with Cnctioning of Inspector of Accidents.

Accident to Indian Airlines Boeing
737 aircraft VT-EFL on 16th August,
1991 near Imphal


MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION & TOURISM

DECISION OF GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ON REPORT OF THE COURT OF INQUIRY
OF THE ACCIDENT TO INDIAN AIRLINES B-737 AIRCRAFT VT-EFL
NEAR IMPHAL ON 16.8.1991:

On 16th August, 1991 an Indian Airlines Boeing-737 aircraft VT-EFL
crashed near Imphal while operating a flight IC-257 from Calcutta to Imphal.
The flight was under the command of Capt. Shekhar Haldar with Capt. D.B.
Roy Choudhury as Co-pilot. There were 69 persons on board including 6 crew
members. All occupants died in the crash.

2. Government of India appointed Shri Justice Umesh C. Banerjee of the
Calcutta High Court to hold a formal investigation into the accident under Rule
75 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Shri B.P. Baliga, Formerly Director of Engineer -
ing, Air India and Wg. Cdr. P. Ashoka, Executive Director (Flight Operations &
Safety), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, Bangalore were appointed as asses-
sors to the Court of Inquiry. The report of the Court of Inquiry was received by
the Government on 30.4.1992.

3. The Court of Inquiry has concluded the ’Probable Cause of the Accident’
as follows :

"The accident occurred by reason of a grave error on the part of the
Pilot-in-Command in not adhering to the operational flight plan and
ILS let down chart and not realising that his early descent to 10,000
feet and turning right for outbound leg without reporting overhead
VOR would result in loss of time reference and as such misplace him
in the hilly terrain. The Pilot-in-Command’s action may have been
influenced by his extreme familiarity with the terrain".

The Court has ruled out sabotage and structural failure as the cause of
the accident. The Court has made 40 findings and 50 recommendations.

4. The Government have accepted the report of the Court of Inquiry along
with the findings and the probable cause of the accident. Comments on each
finding are given at Annexure 'A’.

5. The recommendations made by the Court of Inquiry aim at enhancing

the safety of aircraft operations and are generally accepted for implementation
as indicated in Annexure ‘B' attached.

FINDINGS

The aircraft had valid Certificate of
Airworthiness and was maintained in
accordance with the approved
maintenance schedules. The air-
craft was fully airworthy prior to Its
departure from Calcutta and during
the course of the entire flight.

The flight crew had appropriate and
valid licences to operate the flight.
Both the pilots have been medically
fit throughout their flying career.

The weather at Imphal at the time
of crash was - Visibility 7 Kms.,
Clouds 3/8 800 feet, 5/8 1800 feet,
1/8 cb 3000 feet, 8/8 10,000 feet -
which was above the operator's
weather minima for an ILS app-
roach at Imphal.

The ATCO had passed to the air-
craft the weather prevailing at 0630
UTC but had not passed the
weather of 0700 UTC which was
same as of 0630 UTC except that
1/8 cb 3,000 feet was not prevailing
at 0630 UTC. The cb was however,
iocated in the North-East direction of
the airport whereas the aircraft
approached form South-West di-
rection. The upper wind at 3.1 Kms
(10160 feet) estimated by India
Meteorological Department at 0600
UTC was 120 /10 Knots.

The landing and navigational aids
(ILS, VOR & NDB) at Imphal Aero-
drome were functioning normally on
the day of the accident. Locator
Beacons at ILS markers however,
have not been provided. The last
calibration was effected on 5th
June, 1991 and was valid on the
date of the accident.

Status Indicator lights of ILS were not
functioning in the Control Tower on
the day of the accident and had, in
fact, been in such a state for quite
some time past.

DME co-located with VOR had not
been installed till the day of accl-
dent even though NAA had _ te-
ceived the equipment at Imphal in
July, 1991. The DME, however, was
subsequently installed and made
operational on 29th November, 1991.

Distance Measuring Equipment
(DME) is a helpful navigational aid
but cannot be termed to be an es-
sential navigational aid. Non-avail-
ability of DME at Imphal has not
contributed to the accident.

Installation of Automatic Direction
Finder - AD-200 at Imphal Airport is
not considered necessary on the
threshold of 21st century, more so
by reason of the availability of VOR
which is a modern navigational and
more effective pilot interpreted aid.

At Imphal there is no equipment in-
stalled to provide Runway Visual
Range information which would be
of great assistance to the pilots for
carrying out instrument approach
and landing during unfavourable
weather conditions.

ATC multi-channel tape recorder
supplied by Stencil Hoffman of USA
was procured by National Airports
Authority and received at Imphal in
early 1983, but has not yet been

Agreed.

It is true that the DME was
received In Imphal at the
end of July, 1991 and was
installed and commissioned
on 29th November, 1991, It
takes about 3 months to
install and declare a navi-
gation system operative like
the DME. Considering the
rainy season at Imphal time
taken for installation is rea-
sonable.

installed even after nine years of
procurement,

By reason of non-availability of the
AIC tape at the Control Tower at
Imphal, performance monitoring of
ATCOs has become an extremely
difficult.

ATCOs are not having — sufficient
familiarisation flights,

Air Traffic Control at Imphal Airport
on the day of the accident was
manned by an officer not formally
rated by National Airports Authoiity,
though the concerned ATCO had
been informally authorised to handle
the air traffic by a senlor officer at
Imphal.

The Senior Aerodrome Officer being
Q formally rated Air Traffic Con-
troller, was available at the aero-
diome but not at the Control Tower
at the time of the crash.

No refresher courses are arranged
by National Airports Authority for
their Alr Traffic Controllers.

Licensing of Air Traffic Controllers has
nof yet been effected.

Licensing of aerodromes also Nas not
yet been effected,

There are no maintenance schea-
ules for ground navigation, commu-
nication and landing aids.

from other similar equip-
ments,

Agreed,

NAA have initiated steps to
Procure and _ install such
tape recorders at airports
to which Indian Airlines is

vices.

DGCA has already appro-
ved 250 familiarisation  fij-
ghis to ATCOs per year.

NAA has now introduced
the system of ratings for ail
ATCOs.

Agreed.
However, a qualified ATCO
was present in the tower
and was handling ail air
traffic at that time.

The flight crew did not adhere to
the operational flight plan after
coming overhead Comilla. They did
not go overhead Agartala VOR and
instead flew almost directly to
Imphal from Comilla,

The flight crew gave incorrect call-
out to Agartala ATC that they were
overhead Agartala VOR even
though the aircraft was nowhere
near Agartala VOR,

The flight crew commenced de-
scent nearly 10 minutes before the
top of descent prescribed in the
Operational — flight plan without
realising that the same would result
in a change of Estimated Time of
Artival,

The flight crew requested Imphal
ATC for setting course directly out-
bound for ILS let down, which was
cleared by the ATC. This was pro-
cedurally a wiong call-out by the
flight crew, Permission by the Air
Traffic Controller for direct outbound
could not possibly have misled the
pilot not to come overhead VOR,

The flight crew gave wrong altitude
call-outs to Imphal ATC on a number
of occasions during descent and let
down which can only be termed as
an act of indiscipline.

The aircraft never came overhead
lmphal VOR even though the ATC
had asked it to report overhead.

The flight crew reported approach-
ing overhead VOR even though the
aircraft was about 14 miles away
from Imphal VOR at that point of
time,

The flight crew had initially intimated
to Imphal ATC the estimated time of
arrival as 07:16 hours UTC. How-
ever, after setting course directly to
Imphal from Comilla they revised
their ETA to 07:12 hours UTC.

The possibility of the flight crew
being misled by reason of false Indi-
cation of the VOR is ruled out,

The flight crew by vittue of not
reporting overhead VOR and turn-
ing right much shorter of the same,
instead of turning left overhead VOR
for tear drop entry, lost the time ref-
erence required for carrying out ILS
lef down.

Till the time of impact the aircraft
was not on localizer or glide path.

There was total lack of discipline
and professionalism during the flight
on the part of the flight crew by not
adhering to the operational flight
plan as also the ILS let down chart
together with wrong position reports
and altitude call-outs,

The — Pilot-in-Command = did not
adhere to the ILS let down chart but
instead seems to have relied upon
the ground features with which he
thought he was extremely familiar.

The flight crew committed a grave
error of not realising. that early com-
mencement of descent to 10,000
feet and turn to right without com-
ing overhead VOR would misplace
them in the hilly terrain further away
from the airport.

No emergency condition was com-
municated by the flight crew during
the entire course of flight till the time
of impact.

The co-pilot throughout the flight
remained as a mere passive and
mute speciator to the deviations
from the prescribed operational
procedures,

Tail wind of even 60 knots during
outbound leg could not have drifted
the aircraft to the place where the
crash has taken piace if the ILS let
down procedure was adhered to.

About six seconds prior to the im-
pact, GPWS warning came ‘ON’,
but if was not possible to clear the
hill ahead even If the crew had
taken immediate action to climb.

The crash occurred on the Thang-
jing Hill about 300 feet below the hill
peak and at a distance of 20.19
nautical miles from VOR Imphal Alr-
port as per the distance estimate
given by the Directorate of Survey
(Ain.

There was no evidence to indicate
any sabotage or inflight structural
failure of the aircraft.

Search and rescue operations were
carried out in a manner as is ex-
pected in the circumstances as
were prevalent on the date of the
accident at crash site.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The Indian Airlines should reiterate
to all its pilots that they must meticu-
lously follow all stipulated opera-
tional procedures.

The Flight Safety Directorate of
Indian Airlines should be restructured
SO as to Introduce a flight standardl-
sation cell which would be responsi-
ble for surveillance checks on board
the aircraft as also simulator training
and monitoring of other related
operational aspects, This should,
however, be in addition to the
routine proficiency checks as js
prevalent,

The operator should cary out ran-
dom checks of Cockpit Voice Recor-
der, Flight Data Recorder and Digital
Flight Data Recorder and the DGCA
should ensure compliance thereof,

The training programme of the
operator ought to inculcate a sense
of cockpit discipline amongst the pl-
lots in order to ensure smooth and
efficient operation of the flight with
meticulous observance of stipulated
procedures.

Indian Airlines training programme
should emphasise the need for cor-
rect call-outs by pilots and under no
circumstances the pilot should in-
dulge in wrong and inappropriate
call-outs.

The Indian Airlines training prog-
ramme ought to provide that the
pilots should be guided by available
navigational aids rather than the
visual ground fixes specially on an
IFR flight.

indian Airlines. should Include an
exercise in fhe syllabus for simulator
training as regards the pilot’s reac-
tion to the triggering of the GPWS.

Co-pilots training ought to match
with that of the Pilot-in-Command
since the former is acting as a
safety pilot and may be required to
fake charge should it be so requi-
red.

The operator ought to hold flight
safety meetings regularly and the
entire Directorate of the operator
requires restructuring and revamping
so as to be more effective in the
matter of flight safety.

Periodic meetings between the
Operations Manager, Flight Safety,
and the Line Pilots ought to be
arranged so as to derive benefit
from the experiences of other pilots.

Proper liaison be maintained be-
tween the Flight Despatch, Opera-
tional Personnel including engineer-
ing and the Hight Safety Directorate
of the operator by way of meetings
at regular intervals.

The career pattern of pilots as js
existing today with the operator
(Indian Airlines) ought to be review-
ed in the light of observations made
in the report.

The operator through their training
programme ought to encourage
and impress on junior pilots and con-
vince them that they not only have
the right but indeed have the re-
sponsibility to speak up if they dis-
agree with senior pilot’s action.
They must be reassured that they will
not suffer displeasure or recrimination

The senior pilots must equally be told
that if they do not accept or indeed
ridicule a junior pilot's actions in this
regard then their own behaviour is
unacceptable to the airline.

The operator must inculcate in the
whole body of the pilots the philos-
ophy of team work while operating
a flight.

Cockpit Resource Management
Course ought to be introduced
without any further loss of time and
if necessary even an outside mana-
gement consultant may be appro-
ached for proper and effective
guidance in regard thereto and all
pilots are to undergo the same
course in order to promote better
cockpit management for safe flight
operations.

The cabin crew training programme
shouid be standardised and no
departure from the prescribed train-
ing syllabus ought to be permitted.

The operator should ensure that all
mandatory documents are upto
date and carried on board. The
DGCA Airworthiness Officers should
carry out random checks and moni-
tor compliance of the same.

All Boeing 737 Aircraft operating in
the country and registered by the
Director General of Civil Aviation
should be fitted with Digital Flight
Data Recorder as also Emergency
Locator Transmitters capable of
impact as well as water activation.

approval.

Instrument let down charts of air-
ports specially in the hilly terrain
ought to be reviewed by National
Airoorts Authority in consultation with
the operator and seek the approval
of DGCA.

Necessary equipment should be iIn-

airport of the country.

The implementation of the earlier
recommendation in regard to licens-
ing of ATCOs and Aerodromes
should be effected forthwith by
creating an adequately staffed new
wing in the Office of the Director
General of Civil Aviation.

The DGCA should ensure inspection

should exercise strict supervision by
carrying out more frequent spot
checks for better quality control in
all relevant areas.

INTRODUCTION

it has happened again - on Friday the 16th August, L9O9L,
the nation was stunned over the broadcast on AU India Radio and
Doordarshan in regard lo a major air accident wherein there were
no survivors. This time again it is a scheduled flight of a sched-
wed operator - tndian Airlines and the flight being IC-257 from
Calculta to dJnmiphal.

After the Kanishka accident in June L985, the country
breathed a sigh of relief at least for nearly three years but it has
Starled again and in a consistent fashion from August, 1988
ouwards. In July, 1988, Pawan Hans Westland helicopter ona
routine flight from Jammu to Vaishno Devi crashed, in which all
the seven people unfortunately while ona pilgrimagse died. In
August, 1988, the Dauphin helicopter belonging M/s Pawan Hans
crashed near Pondicherry. Two several accidents thereafter in
October, 1988 within a matter of few hours stunned the nation
and the operators were Vayudoot and Indian Airlines. The occur-
rences being at Guwahati and Alumedabad respectively. Again in
September, 1989, a Dornier aireraltl belonging to Vayudoot also
crashed near Pune leaving no survivors. Within a period of three
months there was the Pawan Hans helicopter crash in December,
1989, near Patna. That is not the end of the accidents in our Civil
Aviation sector. In February, 1990, one of the most serious air
accidents of a most modern aircratt (A-320) did lake place at
Bangalore in which 92 persous died though providentially, howev-
er, 54 persons could escape the fatality. The next in the Une is in
August, 1991, at lnphal killing all G9 bersons on board including
the crew.

Considering the above data, there were thus, in fact, eight
accidents in three years between July, 1988, to August, 1991, In
which 363 valuable lives were lost.

The time has, therefore, now come to consider seriously as to
the happenings in Wie Civil Aviation sector in the country anda
proper Introspeclion ought to be effected without losing any further
time - introspection to detail out our manner and method of work-
lng so far as the civil aviation industry is concerned in the couulry.
Courts of Inquiry have been constituted in the past - inquiry re-
ports have also come. I am sure the Government must have also
linpleimented quite a good number of the recommendations of
those Courts of Inquiries, but practicabilily of the situation,
however, demands more and not to be content with the recom-
mendations or implementations thereof. It is at this slage that this
introspection is required - there must be something wrong some-
where as otherwise consistently from August, 1988 lo August,
1991, so many fatal accidents would not have been there. We
should not be content with what we have done but we will have to
cousider as lo what is to be done in the matter of prevention of
future accidents of this nature. Human lives are precious aud
invaluable. Monctary conipensation or a word of sympathy will not
do - we will have to rise up to the occasion to stop the recurrence
of the same, which is otherwise avoidable in nature. The sense of
discipline ought to be inculcated in such a way so as lo restore the
feeling of confidence in our national airline which at present is in a
gradual decline aud I suppose no blame can be attributed to the
travelling community of the society, moreso by reason of the
happenings in the aviation industry of the country in the recent
past as narrated above. Incidentally, it is not out of place to
mention that apart from the incidents noted above, which turned
out to be fatal, there are very many minor ones (not so fatal, but

could have been so) as appears from lic media.

Tam not trying to impute any failure om anyoue but there is
no dental of fact that a feeling of insecurity is gradually gaining
ground in the uiunds of the people as regards the safely of air travel
in this country. I am conscious of the fact that the number of
accidents in our country may not be that much as js in some other
countries but that in my view cannot be a solace - that ought not

lo give a sense of colplacency tn us so that we can take Uiings as
they are and leave it for the future to do the needful. The tine and
the hour has come for us to rise up to the oceasion and do our

utniost to save such fatalities.

The effort of the Government in the matter of prevention of
such fatalities, however, cannot but be appreciated. No sooner the
accident occurred at Imphal, the Minister of Civil Aviation and
Tourism announced over the media that this accident shall be
Investigated bya Judge of the Nigh Court and in pursuance
whereof I was appointed to head the Court of Inqury under Rule
75 of the Aircraft Rules 1937 with two assessors - Shri B.P. Baliga
and Wg. Cdr. Pp, Ashoka, one. belonging to the cnginecertng disei-
pline and the other a very renouned lest Pilot of the country. tn
terms of the notification, the time to complete the inquiry and to
make the report was stated lo be 31st December, 1991, but subse-
quently by two several notifications dated 20th December, 199]
and 31st March, 1992, the Uine to make the report was extended
uplo 30th April, 1992. A copy of the original notification dated
26th September, 1991 is however, annexed to this report for
convenicuce sake and ts darked with letter A.

Furthermore, the subsequent request of the Government to
te Court to visit Australia and Singapore so as to have a comlpara-
live analysis of our Civil aviation system goes to show in my view,
the Slucerily of the Government in the matler of salety of the air
Passengers.

IL is lo be noted that at the request of the Government, I did
visit Sydney so as lo undertake a study of the Civil Aviation Indus-
ty in Australia and on my way back homie | did also visit, though
for a short while, Singapore to appraise myself of the systems
followed by the two inost renouned airlines of the world today,
nainely, the Qantas Alrways and Singapore Alrlines,

Brielly slated it has been a well-worth visit to Australia and
Singapore: How an alrline operator engages ilself in its operational
sphere having due regard to the salely aspect is seen to be be-
Heved. The culture, the system control, the outlook, the sincerity
for the purpose together with the devotion to the concept of air
passengers safety needs Special mention.

As regards Qantas Airlines, the thing which is of utmost
importance is the outlook of Qantas cullure. Actions shall have to
be taken agaiust any iinpropriety or deviation from Qantas culture,
but that should not be punitive in Mature - it is not what has
_ happened but how to prevent the recurreuce of the same - this
particular outlook has brought Qantas the Nae and flame as (hey
are enjoying today throughout the globe. -Another redeeming
fealure of Qantas cullure is the rellauce on to the pilots’ union: (he
Management in Une event of a departure of the flying norms (hougt
takes note of the Situation, but it is the union which, in fact, takes
care of the situation. Confidence on to the union to tus extent,
cannot but demand praise and appreciation. In the event, howev-
er, there is recurrence of such a deviation from the flying norms
more than one occasion, it is the Qantas culture again that would
Pproinpt the Management to consider the matter in its retrospect -
analyse the situation inchiding the training aspect and if tt is so
felt necessary then and in that event the trainer himself gels a
further training to impart training to the flying crew - an unique
effort for safety of air passengers.

Does the Operator in our country goes to this extent that a
small deviaUon needs that much of care and attention - do we have
the time, energy and the inclination - the answer probably be not
In the affirmative. Noleworthy here that itis the operator and not
the regulatory authority which takes this much of pain to study
the entire situation and see that the deviations, however, small in
nature do not recur again - public salety is predonunant in Quan-
tas culture. We do also have in our national airlines a Directorate
of Air Safety, but tunfortunately the Air Safety Directorate does not

even hold a meeting for a Perlod of three years. Can it be said to
be a situauion which is conducive to publle Salely - my answer
unfortunately cannot but be in the uegative.

I cannot but help noUng another aspect even at this Juncture
concerning the executive pilots. As in our system, the executive
Pilois in Qantas Airlines do also fly, As a matter of fact the entire
operallonal Managenient is being aduunistered by the flyers only -
but there exisis a difference and the difference being - whereas the

if not slightly more, Qantas however docs nol allow its exectuive
Pilots to fly more than one-third of what a line pilot does: the
reason is not, however, far to seek - the entire administrative
Super structure consists of the executive pilots and if they fly as
the line Pllots do, where Is the time to devote on to the organisa-
tonal aspect and other adniunistrative works - where ts (he ime to
(hin: and evolve the best Salely methods.

Incidentally, against a pointed question asked by mie to Capt.
Mehta to the Same elfect, the auswer of Capt. Mehta was that
sufficient time is available to look into the administrative and
organisational aspect also - there lies probably the difference + we
take things as they are : we have no intention nor any inclination
to give it a thought about the whole situation. We want lo contin-
ue with the exis ling system as ihey are : altitude of the Australian
Civil Aviation Industry is, however, slightly different - It is a salety-
oriented approach and they evolved the system in such a way so
that the entire system can develop in its proper perspective having
due regard to the Safely aspect. | will be falling in my duty iff do
ol mention, however, here iiself, that all the exceulive pilots are
duly compensated in terms of money and they get a fixed reiu-
neration having due regard to the flying tne with which the execu.
live pilots otherwise would have been associated. The entire super
structure, therefore, of our naUlonal operator needs a change and it
is for the Government and the operator to look into the matter as
otherwise there will only be a compronuse with the Safety of air
Passengers,

4n

The operator's organisational structure needs {to be revamped so
that a cullure is Introduced) which by iiself would nepale any
chance or risk aud will promote safely. The details of the study
undertaken by me at Australia and Singapore will appear in this
report, suffice it to note, however, that the regulatory authorily
ought to exist ouly for the purpose of supervision of the whole
system and it is the operator which needs to concentrate and
evolve the system of safely by which air travel in this country will
be as safe as in Australia or in Singapore. I ani not prepared to
accept that we lack efficiency in any way, but what we lack is the
system control and the Management and the operalor should now
give ila thought in order to bring home the concept of safety in the

nunds of air passengers which is ina gradual decline at present.

2. THE UNF ORTUNATE FLIGHT

fudian Airlines MUght 1C-257 from Calculta to liophal and
then on to Dimapur was a scheduled Hight of the operator. The
aircraft used was a Bocing 737 having registration number VT-EFL
under the conunaud of Capt. Sekhar Haldar and Capt. D.B. Roy
Choudhury was the Co-pilot. In accordance with usual practice,
Hight bricfing was effected at the Might despatch of the operator
and records to that effect were duly produced before the Court of

pilot and the co-pilot and the usual Boeing 737 flight plan was
made over to the flight crew members which reads as follows: -

As per the flight plan, the aircraft had 7,900 kgs of aviation
fuel though the requirement was of 7785 kgs which takes note of
APU fuel, alternate fuel, holding fuel, Manoeuvre and taxi fuel.
From the actual trim sheet, it appears there was also in fact 7,900
kgs. of fuel on board the aircraft and as such it can sately be
coucluded that the aircraft had sufficient fuel to operate the sector
Calcutta to huphal as a scheduled flight NoIC-257,

Oe

The flight crew detailed to operate the flight consisted of
Capl. Sekhar Haldar as the Commander, Capt. D.B. Roy Choud-
hury as the Co-pilot with four cabin crew members Mrs. Surlya
Sen; Mrs. Sipra Majunidar; Miss Minoti Ray and Miss Sonali Roy.
There were allogether 63 passengers inclusive of one child o
board of which 31 passengers with the child were booked for
huphal and 31 for Dimapur.

The scheduled departure time of the flight from Calcutla was
1130 am. UST) on 16th August, LOOT and the aireratl, tu fact,
taxied out at 11.50 a.m. and it was airborne at 11.54 a.m. from
runway 19L at Calcutta alrport. The ATC tape-trauscript depicts
that inilially the aircraft was cleared to flight level 70 (7,000 feel)
on track and from flight level 70 to flight level 150 (15,000 Icel)
under Radar aud further from: Dhaka Control. The materials ou
record show that the aircraft was cleared to Imphal via route B-593
and W-54 with flight level 290 (29,000 feet} having total flying time
GO minutes for this particular sector (Calcutla-lmphal). The air-
craft in accordance with the usual flight plan did call at Comiulla
and reported “approaching overhead Alpha-Alpha Tango". the
Cockpit Voice Recorder also depicts that the aircraft did contact
abeam Silchar and thereafter caine in contact with Imphal at
12:34:45 hours (IST). At this stage, the aircraft conununicated the
revised ETA to linphal and asked for descent clearance, which was
granted. At 12:36:57 hours (IST) the ATCO at Imphal cleared the
{light IC-257 to descend to 10,000 feet and asked to report over-
head VOR for ILS Runway 04. At 12:39:45 hours (IST) the aircraft
UC-257) Inlinated the Tower that the aircraft is now 12 mules
inbound at 10,000 feet and the Tower at Imphal asked the Pilot
(iC-257) to maintain and report overhead VOR. Imuinediately
thereafter, however, within two seconds the pilot asked the ATCO
as to whether they can set course directly outbound for let down
and the ATCO at Imphal did permit the same. AT 12:41:29 hrs.
(IST) the aircraft transmitted that they are approaching overhead

and three seconds thereafter the Tower transuiilled a message


which reads; “understand you are procecding on a radial 217 for
ILS" and four seconds thereafter the alrerafl replied as alfirmative?
The Tower however imuncdiately asked lo give a call commenuciug

ithe procedure tur.

At 12:42:13 hrs. (IST), the aircraft was asked by hnphal ATC
to proceed outbound for ILS approach for runway 04 descending to
5,000 feet. In the mean time, Imphal ATC allowed IC-890 to enter
runway 04 for take off to Guwahati. Proper separation was given
between IC-890 (departing aircraft) and IC-257 the arriving alr-
craft. This aircraft was also informed about the traffic.

At 12:44:50 lrs. (ST), the aircraft (IC-257) reported com-
mencing procedure turn. However, after departure of IC-890,
Imphal ATC tried to contact [C-257 but there was no response.
After wailing for some Lime aud giving several calls, Imphal ATC
started emergency procedure followed by search and rescue action.

At about 1700 hrs. (IST) bnphal ATC came to know through
police wireless that the aircraft (IC-257) was found to have crashed
ona hill (Thaugjing) at a distance of approximately 20.5 NM on the
approach path of runway 04 of Luphal Aerodrome. The estiniated
coordinates of the crash point are Lat. 24° 29° 54"N_ Long. 93° 40°
20"E. The aircratt crashed at 12:46:23 brs. (IST) under juclement
weather condition having low cloud, occasional rain.

After the impact with the hill the aircraft was coipletely
destroyed. All the G9 persons on board lost their lives. There was
post crash fire and as appears from the materials on record the
wreckage of the ill-fated plane with nose and front section disinte-
graled into pieces and were found South-West of lnphal acro-
drome at a distance of approxiinately 20.5 nautical miles and
about 300 feet below the highest point at that location in the form
roughly of an inverted ’L’. The long arm of inverted "L’ stretched to
approximately 300 to 400 metres and short arm stretched 50 to 75
mictres as per visual estimate. There were burnt patches and the


area looked brown. The direction and spread of the wreckage
indicated a head-ou-crash and a graze on the slope of the hill, The
vegelalion aud trees were either burnt duce to sprinkling of aircralt
{uel and hot debris immediately after the crash or were cut in the
direction of the hill at the time of the crash and was found Huiited
to the crash site. The factum of existence of unburnt material
including currency notes points to a definite direcUioun thal the fire
was after the crash. The damage to the aircraft was lotal by

reason of disintegration duc to the impact with Une hill.

Relevant extracts of the tape transmission as appears front
the Cockpit Voice Recorder of the ill-fated aircraft ought to be
noted at this Juncture and as such the same are reproduced below.
The details of the enUre transmission, however, would appear from

a schedule annexed to this report and marked with Lelters ‘AA’.

3. POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION OF CRASH VICTIMS

1C-257 having taken off from Calcutta on LGU August, 1991,
crashed near lmphal around 12:46 hrs (IST) killing all 69 persons
on board the flight consisUng of G3 passengers inclusive of one
infant passenger and 6 members of the crew. From the report of
Wg. Cdr. Dr. J.K. Gupta, Assistant Director General Medical Serv-
ices in the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation, it ap-
pears that four bodies were brought down, identified and post
mortem work was conducted on the night of 17th August, LY9t.
The next Usree days te. 18, 19 and 20th August, 19OL, were spent
in conducting the post mortenis of the victhms as and when they
were brought down from the crash site. The post mortcms were
conducted al the Regional Medical College, Mortuary Imphal by a
team of doctors of the Department of Forensic Medicines of the
college lead by Dr. L. Femate, Associate Prof. of Forensic Medichic.
Alt the bodies were duly identified and forensic examinations were
had before the post mortem examinations of the bodics. The
evidence on record of Dr. Femate unmistakably suggesis that there
was no chance, considering the injuries on the bodles, of lile,
hninediately after the crash. Dr. Femate also stated that apparent-
ly whereas one or two bodies bore no sign of external injury, but by
reason of the intensity of the internal injuries, question of there
being any chance of Ife was not there and the death was tnsiantea-
neous. According to Dr. Femate the burn injury may be simul{a-
neous though burn iajury alone ts uulikely lo cause death. The
traumatic Injuries apart from the burns were fmuimediately fatal in
nature. On the Issue of the cause of injury, Dr. Femate’s detinite
evidence {ts that almost all the injuries have been caused by the
impact against the front seats and the back metal of the seats
would be capable enough to cause the same.

While it is true that no carbon monoxide deposit tests were
carried oul at the tmphal Mortuary, (he samples of (he lungs of the
victinis particularly of the pilot and cabin crew were made over lo
the appropriate authority for being tested at the InsUlute of Avia-

17


ion Medicine al Bangalore and Wg. Cdr. Gupta’s report to this
Court expressly point out that samples of Ussucs from the bodies
of the pilot and co-pilot as well as one cabin crew member were
collected and sent to IAM Bangalore for examination. Wg. Cdr.
Gupta on the basis of the Toxology Report from IAM noted that,
there is no evidence of ante-mortem injury burns or carbou monox-
ide toxicity. For convenience sake the remarks column of the
report of LAM autopsy is quoted herein below:-

"All Ussues show autolytic changes. The changes in
the lungs are consistent with traumatic clology. No
evidence of ante-mortem tnjury/burns or carbon
Inonoxide toxicity."

A copy of Lhe report of Wg. Cdr. J.K. Gupla, however, is also
annexed hereto and marked with Letter ‘B’.

The observations of Wg. Cdr. Gupta who attended the pust-
mortem exaiminaUlon along with two doctors of the operator (Indian
Airlines), namely, Dr. Das and Dr. Bhattacharya ought for conven-
fence sake be noted at this Junclure in regard to the injury pattern

on the victims and the same are as follows :

i) Practically all the victims had a crash injury of
tlic head and face, hyperflexive tnjuries of the sternum
and dorsal vertebrae.

ii} <dassive deccleralive injuries of the heart lungs,
Hlaphragi and abdominal viscera,

iii) Some distinguishable lap belt tnfuries of the
mescutry and the gulas well as pubic symphysis.

iv) The lower limbs had bilateral both bone frac-
tures mostly in the lower 1/3.

v) Most victhius also had fractures of one or both
arm bones.

vi) There was no evidence on gross examination of
carbon monoxide inhalation,

18


vil} There were no distingulshable aute-mortem
burns. Some sprinkle burns (possibly post mortem)
were noliced on the skin of some of the bodies. The
charring of the few bodies (4-5) appeared to be post
mortem as a result of limited post crash fire.

vill) There was no evidence of any penetrative or
nussile like injuries.

ix} An interesting feature was the claw hands con-
figuration of both pilots with mulliple fractures of
small bones of both hands.

x) More than GO% of (he bodies which were re-
celved more (han 48 hrs. of the crash showed signs of
putrefaction and were defaced."

As regards the medical records of the flight crew the same is
deall with wuder the heading "Crew Information" and as such need
not be dealt with at (hls Juncture.


4. AIRCRAFT INFORMATION :

1) General:

The Boeing 737 Jet Transport is designed to operate over
short-lo-medium ranges. Wing high-lift devices permit operations
from airports not formerly accessible to jet transports. The 737-
200 is 100 fect long and has a 93 feet wlng span. The maxtmum
operaling alr speed is approximately 350 knots EAS or 0.84 Mach.
inaxiinum certiffed altitude Is 35,000 feet.

ip Engine :

The airplane is powered by two Pratt and Whilney JT8bD
turbo fan engines mounted under the wings. The cngine is a
forward-fan-type engine with a twin-spool axial compressor. The
engine has mine can-annular burners in the combustion chamber,
and is provided witha multi-stage reaction-impulse turbine. The
miulll-stage axial compressor cousists of a low pressure unlit, which
includes the fan stages, and a high pressure unit. The low pres-
sure ull is connected by a through-shalt to the turbine wheels for
the low pressure compressor, and the high pressure unit is con-
nected independently by a hollow shaft to the turbine whieel for the
high pressure compressor. ‘The cugine Is cyuipped with a full
length annular fan-discharge duct. A hydromechanical fuel con-
trol governs the rotor speed of the high pressure compressor, aud
schedules [uel {low to provide the thrust called for by the thrust
lever setUng in the cockpit.

The wing mounted engines assures "eye-level maintenance."
The cowl panels hinge at the top of the engines or detach so that
inmost components are accessible without a stand. Engine accesso-
res, plumbing, wiring, ducting, and fire wall attach points for the
(wo engines are identical.

20


The cngine inlets are forward of dict, dust, and other tor clpn
juatenal alrborne In the wake of the matin landing gear and laps,
The inlet environment of the wing mounted engines provides clean
bleed air for the alrconditioning system. The engines are located
far enough outboard to clear waler or slush spray pattern from the
nose gear. Reverse thrust !s accomplished by two hydraulically
acllvated deflector doors which block engine exhaust pas flow and

deflect the exhaust stream forward.

Engine accessories are easily reached from the ground by
opening linge mounted engine cowlings. The oil tank, fuel/otfl
heal exchanger, and supplementary fuel heaters are integral
cngine parts. Each engine has a 40 KVA geucrator with a constant
speed drive. Pneumatic cugine starters are operated by air sup-
plied through the pneumatic manifold from cither the auxiHary
power uit, the ether engine, or a pneumatic ground cart.

ill) Electrical :

Primary 115 Volt, 400 Hz. AC electrical power is supplied
from a 40 KVA generator located on each engine. The D.C. electri-
cal system is composed of three 50 ampere transformer -rectifier
(TR) wits, a 22 anipere hour battery, and a battery charger. ‘Tlie
APU drives a siugle 40 KVA generator that may be used for main
generator back up power in ght, and cau provide power to all
airplane buses. on the ground.

Pilot electrical load mManagenient has been reduced lo a
minimum. In the event of an engine or generator failure, loads
which are necessary to maintain all primary flight functions are
automatically transferred from the dead bus to the remaining
generator system. This continuous priinary power capability
allows the pilot to continue existing [ight operations until he can
review the electrical panel and take remedial action. Transferred
primary loads will not cause an overload sulllcient to (rip the

2]

remaliug generator. The APU may then be started to assume the

total load of the dead bus.

The DC power distribution system also has automatic trans-
fer to preclude any Interruption of power to the primary radto,
flight instruments or flight controls. Ground operation electrical
requirements can be supplied elther by the APU or from a ground
power supply. In either case, all busses can be powered.

iv) Structures:

The structure of the aircraft is designed to provide maximum
strength with odinimuim welght. The materials most conunontly
used are alununium, steel and Inagnesiuns alloys. Aluminium and
fibre glass honey comb matertal is used extensively. The fusclape
Isa sciulmonocoque structure with (he skin reluiforeed by frames
aud stringers. The fuselage consists of four sections of which the
forward three contain the cockpit, passenger and cargo accommo.
dation whereas the fourth section provides the support to the
cmpennage. The doors are removable units which enclose various
coilmpartiniernts of the acroplane and which pernut cniry to or exit
from those compartments by Passengers, crew or Inaintenance
personnel. The doors are divided for their specific purpose tuto
several groups viz. Passcenger/crew doors; cinergency exils; cargo
doors; service doors; fixed interior doors. An electrical door warn-
{ng system is provided to fudicate to the {light crew that all doors
are closed and properly latched before the flight. The structure of
wing consisis of the left wing box, centre wing box and the right
wing box. Throughout the wing, Wc skin panels are reinforced by
Span-wise stringers and spars. The control surfaces along the
trailing edge of each wing consist of inboard and outboard flaps, an
aileron and a total of four spoilers. The fuel tanks are located in
the wings and are inter-connected. The cinpennage comprises a
dorsal fin, a vertical fin, an adjustable horizontal stabilizer, rudder
and elevators. The structure of the acroplane is protected from

corrosion by application of various finishes.

2?


Pressurised air is bled from the engliuc compressor sections
for cabin aircondiUoning (healing, cooling, ventilation), cabin
pressurisation, engine starting, and thermal antt-icing. The
sources of bleed air are the eighth stage compressor and the thir-
teenth slage compressor. Bleed air from these sources is either
used separately or combined as necessary to ensure adequate air
wider high demand conditions. Air front the elghth stage com:
pressor ts used primarily for arconditioning, wing anti-ictag, and
other systems connected into the alreonditioning manifold. Air
from the thirteenth stage comipressor supplements eighiht stage alr
for airconditioning and suppHes hot alr for antl-icing the fuel
healer and nose cowl. High pressure alr for hydraulic reservoir
pressurisaUou also comes from the 13th stage bleed.

Normally, bleed air is used from both engiucs, however,
bleed air from either engine Is sufficient for operation of the
pneumatlcs systems. Airflow is also available from the compressor
section of the APU for engine starling auc arcondiioning on the
ground. The pneumatic system cau also be suppHed directly from
a ground air cart using pressurised air from the cart for engine
SlarUing and for airconditioning.

hydraulic power for the cargo door. The standby system, powered
by a separate electric motor driven Piunp, provides backup power
to the rudder control system and ts also used for alternate exten-
Slon of the leading edge flaps and slats. Alternate operation of the
thrust reverser is provided by the standby system or by accumutla-

tor pressure.

vil) Landing Gear and Brakes

The landing gear Is a conventional iricycle dual-wheel
system. Gear retraction and extension is accomplished with
hydraulic components. The main gear retracts inboard, while the
nose gear retracts forward. The wheels retract to from an effective
wheel-well closure, sealed by a blade fype seal. Inflight brake
coolng Is accomplished by wheel-well ventilation (hrough vents in

the oulboard wheel hubcaps.

xii} Airconditionlug aud Pressurisalion

The airconditioning systcm provides couditioned pressurised
air to the cockpit, passenger cabin, lower nose compartinent, both
cargo comparunents aud the airconditioning distribution bay. Alr
supply to the airconditioning system is furnished in {light by the
pneumatic system from cilher engine bleed alr or the auxiliary
power unit (APU). During ground operation, alr is supped from
engine bleed alr, the auxiliary power unil, a ground prcumatlic
supply cart, or a ground conditioned air supply cart. Part of the
warm air supply from (he cugines or pucumiate cart is passed
through the airconditioning packs to be cooled. The cold air is
then mixed with the remainder of the warm air as required lo
obtain the temperature air called for by the-temperature control
system. This conditioned air then passes into the cockpit and

passenger cabins Ghrough the distribution system,

The outflow valves are regulated to exhaust only that addi-
tional quantity of air required (o maintain the desired pressure in

the cabin.

The pressurisaUon control system provides Uuree independ-
ent modes of operation - automatic, standby and manual. The
system Is clectrically operated, and electrically controlled, and
meters the exhaust of venUlating air to provide controled pressurt-
sation of the cockpil and passcuger cabin, the electrome compart-
ment, both cargo comparunents, and the lower nose comparlinent.
The system is complctely automatic and under normal conditions
requires no adjustuucul by Une Might crew throughout the flight.

xiv) Fire Protection
Airplane fire protection is achieved by use of a fire detection
system aud an overheat detection system, supported by the tire

exUngulshing syslems. ‘The cngine and APU fire detection systems

are clectrical heat sensing systems that respond to a general

28

overhead condition or a localized Ure condition by activating
warning lights and an alarm bell or an outside horn ta Che case of

the APU.

The extinguishing sysicm has lwo separate freon applica-
Uons for either engine. Associated amber discharge lights on the
fire warning control panel will illuminate when either the left or
right bottle has been discharged or the safely relief valve has
melted and botUe pressure is bled off. A separate fire extinguish-
ing bottle is located in the APU compartment for APU fire protec-
ton. Am amber light on the {tre control pancl Wumdnales when
bottle pressure has fallen to approximately 250 psi. In addition,
(wo Indicator disks, a red and a yellow, are tistalled in the alvptarne
skIn on lower right side of {he enipennage to indicate thermal relict

or system discharge.

Emergency equipment includes fire extinguishers, first aid
kils, oxygen, megaphones, and lights for use in the event of an
inflight or landing emergency. Escape slides, escape ropes, and a
crash axe are installed to assist in abandoning the airplane, and to

ald in rescue operation.

xv) Oxygen

Separate high pressure systems supply oxygen to the crew
and passengers. Crew oxygen ts a diluter-demmand type. Passcuger
oxygen is a conUnuous flow system with supplemental walkaround
bottles.

xvi) APU

The auxiliary power unit (APU) is installed in the afl end of
the airplane fuselage, behind the pressure bulkhead, and under
the horizontal stabilizer. A penerator, IdenUeal lo (he engine
generators can furmsh electrical powcr during ground operation or

can be used as a matin generator backup power in fight. The APU

29


also provides pneumatic power for starting, aircondiUoning and
pressurisalion. A safe, accessible installation is provided, with the
APU shock mounted in a sound-proofed coniparunent equipped
with a fire detecUon, warning, and extinguishing systen.

xvil) Warning Systems

The aural and visual warnings alert the flight crew to condi-
lions that require action or caution in the operation of the airplane.
The character of (he signals used varies, depending upon the
degree of urgency or hazards involved. A central switch ts located
on the maim panel, which tests all Wghts and can place the lights in
a bright or dim condition. In (he dim position, (he approach
progress display has au automatic intensity control feature which
will raise or lower the indicator light intensily proportionally to
ambient light conditions.

Aural, visual and tactile signals are used singally or in
combinations to provide simultaneously both warning and infor -
mation regarding the nature of the condition. Red warning lights
located in the area of the pilots’ primary forward field of viston are
used to indicate cngine, wheel-well, APU, or cargo fre, auto-pilot
disconnect (flashing), and landing pear unsalte conditions. Blue
lights when bright Judicate associated valves in Wansit or valves In
disagreement wilh appropriate control switch.

Audible warning for airspeed Hilts is given by a clacker,
cabin altitude by an intermillent horn, and a steady horn in flight
warns that the landing gear Is nol down. An intermittent horn on
the ground warus that the airplane is not in a take off configura-
tion.

Stali warning ts provided by a control column shaker on the

caplain’s control column. Conditions which require caution of the
flight crew are indicated by means of amber caution lights.

and bench check ts requited to be carted out at 1500 hours),

4B. UTILISATION OF NAVIGATION AND COMMUNICATION AIDS :

Navigational information is derived from (he tollowing sys-

fems :-

(a) ADF System - There are two ADF systems on this aircraft.
ADF-1 and 2 are identical except for the pointer. No.1 ADF
is connected to single bar pointer and.No.2 system ts cor-
nected to double bar pointer in RMI on Pilot and Co-pilots
side. Control boxes are located on the pedestal. The ADF
when tuned to a particular station gives bearing of that

station which is read on the RMI.

(b) VOR System - There are two VOR systems on this aircralt.
Two VOR Nav. Receivers of No.l and 2 systems are located in
the Electric and Electromie (2&E) compartment. The VOR
indications are available on RMI one on each side. These
RMI are conunon for ADF also with the transfer possible wilh
selector. The VOR tnformation is also available on the
Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) one on each side. The VOR
stalion frequency is selected in the control box & audio can
be monitored either from pilot or copilot stalion.

(c) Instrument Landing System (ILS) of B737 alrcratt -
VHF/NAV. receiver No.1! used for VOR No.1, is same for
Localizer No.1, Stuilarly Nav. Receiver No. 2 is common to
Localizer No.2. The Localizer frequency is selected in the
control boxes of No.1 and 2.

Glide Slope signal is also processed in the same VHF Nav.
Receiver unit. Thus Nav. Receivers (Systems No.1 & 2)
process signals for VOR, Localizer, and Glide Slope. If Local-
izer frequency 1s selected in No.1 control box and when
signal strength is sufficient cuough, Che lags of pilots side
CDI will disappear and the vertical bar will deflect ‘OFF’
centre depending upon the position with respeet to the


(d)

centre line of the runway, vertical bar will be at the centre.
In FDI (Fight Direelor Indicator) Runway Symbol also moves
laterally agalust an index mark according to position of
aircraft with reference to the centre Line of the runway.

When the ILS frequency is selected either on No.1 or No.2
control boxes, the Glide Slope receivers will be automatically
‘ON’ (paired frequency) and with the capture of glide path
beam the Nag on FDI and CDI (on both pilot and coptlot side)
will disappear. ‘The horizontal pointer (both on pilot and
copllot side) will deflect off the centre. Pilot follows the bar
and pointer to align the aircraft to the centre line of the
runway and glide path. If etther the ground equipment or
the aircraft equipment is faully the flag will appear on the
CDI (Course Director Indicator) and FDI (Flight Director
Indicator).

The Marker Beacon Receiver (one only) is installed in the
E&E compartment. There are two sets of Marker light indi-
cators consisting of three Ughts on each side installed on
pilot and copiloUs instrument panel. "Blue light is for Quler
Marker, ‘Amber’ for Middle Marker; when the atreralt passes
over (he Markers, Nglits will tuminate on both pilot and
copiloUs side. Simultancously audio siguals will be heard in
loud speaker/Head set.

Weather Radar :- A weather radar system consisting of an
antenna, trausrecelver, control module, and Plan Position
Indicator (PPI) is installed on the airplane. The received
signals are converted to a visual picture on the PPL. The PPI
presentation, of ground and weather returns cnablies the
pilot to navigate ulilizing ground returns, or to detect weath-
er and make a decision to penetrate or circumnavigate the

storm cells.

(g)

Low Range Radio Altimeter (LRRA) :-.Two low range radlo
allimeters provide signals fo the autopilot, (pht director
computers and MDA ight. ‘Two tudicators, one on cach pi-

lot's panel, read absolute altitude.

Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) :- The DME receiver
provides the necessary signals lo the DME computer, which
converts the signals to read range to the slauion.

Ground Proximity Waring System (GPWS) : Ground Proxtin-
ily Waratug System (GPWS) provides the pilot with aural and
visual warning of potential dangers of flight path related to
the ground. GPWS processes radio altitude tnformation from
No.1 low rauge radio allmeter (LRRA), allitude rate tiforma-
Hon from Central Alr Data Computer (CADC), Glide Slope
deviation tnformation is derived from VOR/ILS system and
landing gear anid landing Ilap position signal to provide
warning of the following -

. Excessive rate of descent.

NN =

. Excessive terrain closure rate.
. Altitude loss after take off.
. Unsafe terrain clearance.

a Be

- Excessive deviation below glide slope.

Note :- The GPWS will not provide a warning if an airplane is
flying direcUy towards a verUcal cliff. -

GPWS consists of ground proxiinity computer, two warning
Ughts labelled ‘PULL UP’, a wariuug speaker, two glide slope
warning indicators with inhibit facilities labelled "(BELOW
G/s'.

The red warning light labelled ‘PULL UP’ is installed on cach
pilots instrument panel which comes ‘ON’ to provide visttal
Indication. GPWS generates warning of the unsafe flight
path.

37


Rectangular shape amber Glide Slope advisory light labelled
‘BELOW G/S’. is tistlatled o1 each pilots instrument panel.
G/S warning light when pressed inhibits the G/S deviation
working. The warming speaker provides an aural warning of
the unsafe flight path.

MAINTENANCE RECORDS :

Scrutiny of the maintenance records of the aircraft reveal the

following :-

(a)

(b)

(c)

No Mandatory Modificalions/Inspections were outstanding

at the time of the aceldent.

Life Hmited components of the aircraft and engines were

within the preseribed/approved lini.

Repettive defects of last 3 months pertaining to Commnunica-
tion, Aircraft Controls, Radio Navigation Systems and En-
gines were scrutinised. It was observed that -

(i) Flaps not extending to 40 position/getting stuck up
between 30-40 units repeated between 22.5.91 to
4.6.91 (13 days). This was finally rectified on 4.6.91
by replacement of screw Jack assemblies 1 & 8 whicli

were found worn,

(i) On Radio Navigation System "Weather Radar unrel-
able" repealed belween 5.8.91) and 9.8.91. [tt was f{inal-
ly rectifted by replacement of radar Tx. Rx.

(i) =No. | engine N2 tluctuation snag repealed between
21.7.91 to 29.7.91. This was finally rectified by re-
placement of N2 Tacho Generator. It may be men-
tioned that on 24.7.91 also N2 Tacho Generator was
replaced.

(iv) Oil temperature fluctuation snag on No.2 engine

repeated between 4.7.91 and 14.7.91. Tt was tinatly
recUified by replacement of oil temperature bulb.

39


(d) Further, while scruliuising the defects of last six months on

engine of this aircralt following were observed :-

(i) On 6.4.91 EGT gauge fluctuation between 300 to
450°C. This was rectified by cleaning the EGT gauge

plug.

(1) No.2 engine all paraicters shooting up while starting
ov 10.4.91. This was rectified by replacement of Fuel
Control Unit (FCU).

(ii) =R.H. engine cowl valve light ‘comes ON and OFF’ on
23.4.91. Engine cowl valve was replaced.

(iv) No.l EPR gauge sluggish during change of power on
21.6.91. No.l EPR transuiltler was replaced.

(v) On 14.7.91 No.2 engine start up was slow. No.2
engine Ni indicator replaced and No.2 bleed valve

clamp tightened.

(vi) On 7.8.91 No light up during No.1 engine starting,
Igniter box replaced.

(e) Engine Trend Momloring :

The Engine Trend Monitoring System for P&WJTBD-1L7A
engines comprises monitoring of following parameters-

EGT, N1, N2 and Fuel Flow.

With regard to EGT, the shift was +5°C for both engines
against the Umit of 20°C. Also for N1 the shift was 0% against the
Innit of 1.7%. Regarding N2, il was 0% for No.1 engine and 0.4%
for No.2 cugine against the Hmit of 1.3% and for fuel flow the
deviation was 0% for No.l engine and 2% for No.2 cngtne against
the Inuit of 5%.

40

The above trend moniloring covers the period from 3.8.1991
to 12.8.1991 for No.1 engine and 23.5.1991 to 12.8.1991 for No.2
engine.

In view of above, the trend monitoring data reveal that

engine performance during the above period showed no abnormiali-
ty.

(L) Check-B Schedule :

Check-B was carricd oul on this aireralt on the night of
15/16.8.1991. During this inspection, Electrical AME carried
forward the APU generator defect as per MEL as suitable spares
were not available. The snag pertains to APU generator not coming
on line, recorded after the operation of Service No.IC-277 of
15.8.91.

Airframe AME who carried out Check-B Schedule attended
two minor defects - (J) forward attendant seat not secured; (Ji) aft
toilet flushing cable was snapped.

For (i) temporary repair was carried oul and the snag was
carried forward for necessary permanent repair. With regard to (if)
toilct servicing was done al Calcutta. This snag was further car-
ried forward due to non-availability of spares.

5 FDR : CVR READ-OUTS:

The report of the luspector of Accidents as also (he evidence
on record disclosed that the Lockheed Flight Data Recorder
(SI.No.555) was retrieved though ina slightly damaged condition at
its rear portion and a missing front main seal from the crash sile
but the engravings on the aluminium foil were otherwise readable
so as lo appreciate the necessary flight path and other incidental
details in regard to the entire flight from Calcutta to hmphal. It is
true that the staUic connector on front face was found broken and
the pitot maUng connector of the alrcralt had sheared off trom
tubing but the recorder could be opened as per the siateinent of
Shri Satendra Singh, Director Alr Safely al DGCA Headquarters
without any difficulty.

The Flight Data Recorder of the ill-fated flight was decoded
and subsequently reviewed in my presence at the Teclinical Cen-
we, DGCA Headquarters, New Delhi as also in the presence of the -
assessors appointed by the Central Government. It was viewed on
the Nikon Profile Projector and all the engravings on the alumiin-
um. foil could be clearly scen. [Incidentally itis to be noted that
Uiis parlicular Lockheed Flight Data Recorder has basically only
five different parameters, namely, (i) Altitude; (1) Heading: (li) Atr-
speed; (iv) Vertical Acceleralion; (v) Time. This particular FDR
seeis to be a very old type of FDR since all modern aircraft have
filled with a Digital Flight Data Recorder having around 300 sever -
al parameters - obviously making the investigation of any air crash
easier, precise and exhaustive. The lack of other parameters
creates some sort of inconvenience and difficullies in the matter of
invesUgation though, however, it cannot be said to be of an impos-
sibility since the difficullles are not insurmountable in nature. [Ht fs
always better to avail of the latest scientific achievement rather
han depending upon an obsolete method in order to arrive ata
correct Hnading.

42


Incidentally, however, il Is to be noled that out of the five
parameters available on an FIR of the Hike nature, this particular
FDR however recorded only four during the entire course of tight
and the vertical acceleration parameter was available ouly for short
futerval during the take off phase from Calcutta. Therefore, this
particular parameter, namely, the vertical acceleration for all prac-
tical purposes ts not available to this Court of Inquiry for the
Inquiry. The non-avlabilily of (his particular parameter may be
due to two reasons (i) The recording stylus of the unit gol adrift as
a resull it was well neigh impossible to have the engravings on the
aluniliiunm foil and () Loss of vertical acceleration data signal due
to mal-functioning of some systems. It is to be noted, however, in
the event of the happening as at (1) above, It will however, leave a
straight line engraving on the aluminium foil-which was, however,
not seen on the foll. In the absence of which one can safely con-
clude that there was no mal-funcliouing of any system of the FDR
unit but the stylus recording the vertical acceleration got adrift
iumediately after the take off from Calcutta Airport. This deficien-
cy of the stylus getting adrift cannot, however, by any stretch be
said to be a mal-functioning of a unit neither it can be ascribed to
be a defective FDR unit at the time of commencement of journey

from Calcutta.

This Court of Inquiry Gaus Is slightly handicapped by reason
of non-availability of (he vertical acceleration of the aircraft.

The decoding of the FDR foil was taken using a lens of 50 X
magnification and the values of the parameters obtained were
checked for their validity and found to be accurate. The details of
the parameters would appear from a schedule Annexed hereto and
marked with letter "C".

Cockpit Voice Recorder:

On the available evidence it appears that this particular
alreralt VT-EFL was fitted with a (Falrehild Cockpit Voice Recorder

43


Serial No.G519) and was recovered from the crash site though after
some efforts. The evideuce further disclosed that the dust cover
had to be cut for the purpose of opening out this recorder and all
the electronic cards in the rear portion were found severely dain-
aged due to the timpact. The stainless steel crash proof casing was
taken out by cutting the inner casing of the CVR. The stainless
steel box could be opened, however, without any difficulty and the
meguelic tape was found intact. Afler slight adjustment, the tape
could be played and it was noticed that all the recordings were
available. The transcripUion was prepared at the Technical Centre,
DGCA Headquarters, New Delhi by Shri V.K. Chanda, Capt. S.S.
Panesar and Shri L.N. Lal all belonging to the DGCA Headquarters,
New Delhi, and hoiding responsible positfons. The lape transcript
was heard by me along with the assessors and copy thereof was
inade over to all the partles. To be definite about the correctness
of the transcription, I directed that the tape be replayed tu the
presence of all the parties, but since some confusion arose during
the course of hearing, there was a further re-checking at the DGCA
Headquarters at New Dell in the presence of the ICPA olfictals as
it was stated that the colleagues of the pilots operaling the ill-fated
flight could be tn a better position to identify the voices and the
exact transmission. It is to be recorded, however, that slight
inodification of the transcript was affected after having the tape
playcd for a number of occasions. It will not also be out of place to
mention that during one of the Court licarings Shri K.B. Roy
Choudhury being the father of Capt. D.B. Roy Choudhury, the Co-
pilot of the ill-fated aircraft was also requested to identify the voice
of his son - whereas one of the transmissions could be identified,
bul some difficullics was experienced by him in regard to the iden-
fication of other transmissions and hence the second exercise as
above had to be undergone in order to obviate any doubt in the
imatler of correctness of the transcription. Extracts of the CVR
recordings have already been noted above.

44

5.1 FDR AND CVR CO-RELATION:

Al this stage, however, it would be convenient fo note the co-
relation between the FDR readings and the CVR transcript for the
purpose of ascertainment of the correctness of the call-outs from
the aircraft. This in the normal course of events may not be of any
consequence since the FDR reading should match with the corre-
sponding tape transcript bul in this particular unfortunate Juci-
dent it appears that there are certain major discrepancies between
the call-outs and the FDR data.

From the above co-relation, it appears that IC-257 after
reporling approaching overhead Charlie Mike Lima and level 29U
changed the heading from 076° to 053° instead of 007° as per the
flight plan provided by the operator, in this case, the Indian Air-
lines. Subsequent transmission at 06:51:44 from the aircraft to
Agartala Tower to the effect "Roger India 257 approaching overhead
Alpha Alpha Tango’ cannot be said to be a correct transniussion by
reason of the heading, namely, 053 as noted above. On the head-
ing of 053 the aircraft could not possibly have gone overhead Alpha
Alpha Tango. This, therefore, seems to be a wrong call-out and
according to Capt. Mehta, the then Operations Manager of tncdtan
Alrlnes at Calcutta, the aircraft was nowhere near Agartala over-
head and it was a wrong reporting. Capt. Mehta also agreed that
this wrong reporting cannot but be ascribed to be lack of discipline
so far as the pilot was concerned (Capt. Mehta Q. 238 - 241). In
(his context the evidence of Capt. Rahul is of some sipmiffcance: At
first (here was an atlempt on the part of Capt. Rahiut to avoid
answering the question directly as to the factum of the aircraft
being overhead Alpha Alpha Tango by saying that it would be
otherwise tmpossible to be overhead Alpha Alpha Tango since the
obluse angle cannot be availed of by the aircraft and hence there is
a likelihood of violaing the Bangladesh air-space. (Capt. Rahut
Q.19) Subsequently, however, on a pointed question that he being
an expertenced flyer, does he also avoid the fight plan with a
heading of 007 and cut short overhead Agartala by taking 053

direct roule lo Imphal and the answer of Capt. Rahut in no uncer-

47


.laln terms suggest that he belng ai cxpertenced Hyer would tnvar-
lably report overhead Alpha Alpha Tango and there should be no
problem in regard thereto (vide Q. 239). Shoruy thereafter, howev-
er, Capt. Rahut has also stated that even though the other pilot
may not be as experienced as him, he should be able to negotiate
the turn froma heading of 007 without any difficulty (vide Q. 248 -
249}. Incidentally, it is to be noted that the flight plan itself pro-
vides thal after reporting VGCM tc. Comutla with a hheadag of O73"
the aircraft is supposed to proceed at a heading of 007 and should
report overhead VEAT t.e. Alpha Alpha Tango (Agartala). ‘This (igtrt
chart has been prepared by the vperator Itself and there ts ample
evidence on record that the chart should be adhered to ln its
observance rather than tn its deviations. Flight charts are pre-
pared having due consideration of all the relevant and necessary
particulars with one object in mind namely the safety of the air-
craft and when the flight chart specifically provides for reporting
overhead VEAT that should imply that this route prescribed is
otherwise safe and in accordance with law without any violation of
any foreign air-space. As such Capt. Rahut’s evidence in regard to
violation of Bangladesh air-space cannot in my view be accepted
and properly appreciated. Obviously Capt. Rahut’s evidence tn
regard thereto namely the violation of Bangladesh air-space was
under mfsconception of the entire situation to say the least about
it. On the subject, still, the evidence of Capt. M.V.V. Rao also
ought to be noted - unfortunately, with Capt. Rao also there was
an alleimpt to avoid the Issue in regard to the adherence of the
flight chart as prepared by the operator - Capt. Rao has stated that
as a matter of fact in the normal circumstances though there
ought not to be any deviation from the chart but deviations can be
had in regard to the altitude. I have not been able to follow this
particular evidence of Capt. Rao. Fught charts as noted above are
to be observed. Question of deviation therefrom does not and
cannot arise. This laxity ought not to be allowed otherwise the
sancllly of the tight chart ts completely obliterated. 1b should have
thought that the head of the training institute of the operator
should be more fair and frank in regard to the failure if any on the

48


rae

ae

parl of the pilot to follow the flight chart. But unfortunately, Uhere
was an atlempt to avoid auswerlug the question Ina fashion as ts
expected of a ralner. There cannot be any manner of doubt that
under certain exceptional circumstances one may deviate from the
flight chart with the permission of the ATCO, but that can only be
termed to be an exception rather than a regular feature which in
this case as detailed more fully below has happened. I was sur-
priscd that, the evidence of Capt. Rao when he stated before this
Court that as a matter of fact on a plain reading of the CVR he was
exlremely happy as to how a pilot has conducted himself durtag
the course of tlight even though lie had the FDR reading with tifur
which negates such an appreciation. The (raining master ought
nol to be quite content with what he has done apparently bul te
inust go deep into the matter - compare the-actual with the CVR
transcript and see for himself whether it fact he has followed the
procedure or not. There ought not to be a sense of complacency in
a trainer that my pupil has done everything correctly. On the
contrary, the first attempt should be to make oul as to whether
there is any failure ou his part so that the lives of the passengers
are not in any way put into any Jeopardy. Human Hives are pre-
clous. It ought not to be lost by the whim or caprice of a pardeular
individual and this ought to be the subjective training to be im-
parted on lo the trainee. In this context, reference can be had to
Q. No.344 - 347. Ona pointed question, however, Capt. Rao had
to eventually admit that if he was doing the route check and if the
pllol-In-command was following the same pattern he will nol pass
the pilot-in-command to get lus conunand Hcence (vide Q. No.349).

It is pertinent to point out, however, that Capt. Mehta the
erstwhile Operations Manager of Indian Airlines has been extreme-
ly fair and this Court records its appreciation on this score.

Conung back once again on to the co-relation of the FDR
chart and CVR (ranscripl, (appears that at 07:14:01 (he aireratt
calegorically made a transmission to the elfect "We are now 6500",
but in fact, from the FDR it is apparent that the aircraft was ata

49


height of 7600 {cel and not al G500 feet. This transmission also
goes lo show an Incorrect call-out being given by the aircralt.
Capt. Mehta in uo uncertain terms adinitted Uhat the call-out is
wrong since there is difference of about 1,000 feet. Similar is the
trausimssion at 07:14:42 wherein the altitude call-out has been to
the effect 5000; 5900 and on a question from ATCO as to contirma-
“ion of 5000 the call-out from the aircraft was "affirmative". But tn
fact, the alrerall was about 6880 feet - why this wrong call-out,
can it be that the AlUimeter at the front panel have gone wrong,
this possibility according to me prior to the evidence could not be
ruled oul, bul Capt. Mehta in no uncertain terms stated that itis a
wrong call-out and the possibility of the Alumeter golng wrong docs
not and cannot arise. Capt. Mehta stated with conviction that
there are two AlUmeters and two systems are tidependent and
both the systems cannot go wrong shnullancously (vide Q. 421). I
accept (he evidence of Capt. Mehta on this score that no snag can
be said to have occurred so as to render both the Altimeters un-
serviceable during the course of flight. This factum of acceptance
of Capt. Melita’s evidence is based on subsequent scruliny of the
FDR reading and the call-out when both the recordings did in fact

match with each other : To wil,

i) At 06:48:28 aircraft Wransmitted Flight Level 290 aud corre-
spouding FDR data shows 28933 feel.

il) At 06:52:15 the aircratt reported Matitaining level 290 FDR
recorded 28933 feet. Same ts the position at 06:54:22

Mii) At 06:58:34 aircraft transnutted descending froin level 290 and
FDR shows steady descent froin 28933 feet.

iv) At 07:05:00 aircraft transiutted approaching 135, FDR shows
at 07:05:08 14610 feet and continues to descend.

v) At 07:09:45 aircraft communicated allilude at 10,000 and
FDR also records 10,000,

50

vi) Finally, the aircraft crashed at 5209 feet as per FDR, which in
fact, has been the correct altitude at the crash point.

It, therefore, appears that there was no snag so far as the
Altimeters are concerned, rather the discrepancies can be stated to
be by reason of wrong call-outs. The other observations in regard
to the flight path and the adherence to the let down chart and the
timing therefor as appears from the co-relation of the FDR and
CVR recordings will appear under the heading "Flight Path followed
by the ill-fated Aircraft" as more fully detailed hereinafter in this
report. For convenience sake, however, the flight data plot as
appears from the FDR and the corresponding transmissions co-
related on the plot would appear from a schedule annexed hereto
and marked with letter 'D’.

6. FLIGHT CREW INFORMATION

a) Capt.Sekhar Halder, Conunander :

Capt. Sekhar Haldar was born on 10 November 1953. He
was issued with ALTP Licence No. 1415 on 11.3.1988. He was
appointed by Indian Airlines on 22 May 1985 and was deputed to
C.T.E., Hyderabad for initial traming and subscquent training on
Boeing 737 aircrall.

His total flying experience was 3783 hrs. out of which flying
expericuce on Boelug 737 aircraft was 2369 hrs. and 1414 hrs tn
other types of aircraft including F-27 aircraft.

After having flown on Boeing 737 as Co-Pilot, he was given
pilot-in-command endorsement on 27.11.1989 and was having
flying experience as PIC on Bocing 737 for 1115 lirs. The details of
lis recent flying experience are given below -

Experience in last G months — : 254:55 his.
Expcericnce in last 30 days : 62:35 hrs.
Experience in last 7 days : 18:35 hrs.
Eexperlence in last 24 hrs. : 1:50 hrs.

His last medical check was done on 29 July 1991. Date of
last Instrument Rating Check was 10.5.1991 and valid upto
9.5. .1992. Date of last licence renewal was 10.5.1991 and valid
upto 9.11.1991. Date of last Route Check was 14.5.1991 and valid
upto 13.11.1991. FRTO Licence No. 2742 was valid upto
21.1.1992.

Capt. Sekhar Haldar was based at Calcutta.
(b) Capt. D.B.Roy Choudhury, Co-Pilot

Capt. D.B.Rey Choudhury was born on 30 Seplember 1964,
He was issued with CPL licence No. 1592 valid upto 1.9.1991 by

DGCA. He was appointed by Indian Airlines on 24 February 1989

52

aud was deputed to C.T.E., Hyderabad for training. Afler eudorse-
ment on Boctng 737 he was cleared as Co-pilot (P2) on (he (ype. He

has got following Hying experience :-

Total Nying experience : 1647 lis.
Total expericuce on B737 as P2 : 1397 hrs.
Tolal experience in last 6 months : 298:20 his.
Total expericnee in last 30 days : 51:25 lis.
Total experience in last 7 days : 11:30 hrs.
Tolal experience in last 24 lirs. : 1:50 Ins.

His last Route Check was done on 5.5.1991 and valid upto
4.11.1991. Last Instrument Rating Check was done on 21.01.1990
and valid upto 20.11.1991. Last Hccnce renewal was 8.6.1991 and
valid upto 20.11.1991. FRTO Licence No. 3077 valid upto
1.9.1991. He was required to wear corrective glasses.

Capt. D.B. Roy Choudhury was based at Calcutta.

It is to be noted that both Capt. Haldar and Capt. Roy
Choudhury have had the required pre-flight medical examination
for alcohol and was cleared withoul any remarks by the concerned
Doctor wilh a certification "N.A.D" Le. ‘No Abnormalily Detected’.
ILis to be noted, however, that there is no clinical examination as
such but the check is in regard to pre-flight alcohol test. The
proforma for such a cerlification also contains a column to that
effect. The remark 'No abnormality detected’ (NAD) in my view
cannot be termed to be a sufficient certification more so when in
fact there exists a brealh analyser equipment at the Calcutta
airport. Question of there being an abnormality in a pilot when he
is to report for duty does not and cannot arise. The test is not for
the purpose of delection of any abnormality but for an alcohol
check so as to assure that the pilot has the necessary mental equi-
Hbrium during the fight. The certification, Uherefore, ought to be
in consonance with the object for which such a test is asked to be
had before the flight.

53

It is also noted at this juncture, however, thal Wy.Cdr.
Gupla, Asstt. Direclor Medical Services(Air) of DGCA has exaniuied
the report of the samples of tissues collected from the bodies of the
pilot and co-pilot along with the cabin crew and also scruunised
above medical reports of both the pilols and upon such scrutiny
came to a definite finding that both the pilots have been medically
fil (hrough their flying career and there ts nothing to indicate

prescnee of alcohol at the time of the accident.

7. METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION

The ill-fated aircraft 1C-257 took off from Calcutta Airport al
0624 UTC(1154 IST). In accordance with the usual practice the
pre-flight briefing did take place at Flight Despatch of the operator

al Calculla Airport including weather condition at Imphal prevail-
ing al 0430 UTC (1000 IST). The briefed weather as per the Flight
Briefing is to the following effect :-

VEIM 0430; 230/06 Kits; Vis 2000M RA; 4/8 800; 4/8 L800;
6/8 9000 fl; 1/8 CB 25000 fl; T 21; DP 20; 1008; TS overhead.

Pre-fight briefing also records weather at O500 UTC as also
0530 UTC to the following effect :-

VEIM 0500: 270/03 kts: 6 Kin: RA: 3/8 1500 ft: 4/8 1800:
6/8 10000: T 27; DP 22; 1009 HP.

VEIM 0530: wind calin: 8 kin: 3/8 1000 ft: 4/8 1800: 6/8
10000: T 23: DP 22: 1009 HP.

Incidentally it is to be noted thal the alternate acrodrome of
the flight being Guwahati (VEGT) and the weather for VEGT was
also ticluded in the pre-flight briefing.

The aircralt also obtained the Calcutta meteorological condi-
tious at the time of take off and the Tower cleared the aircraft for
take off with surface wind calin.

The ill-fated aircraft came in contact with Imphal ATC at
0653.42 UTC and shortly thereafter huphal weather was given to
the folowing elfect :- wind 270/03 kts; vis. 7 kin; cloud 3/8 800;
5/8 1800; 8/8 10000; T 26; DP 24; QNI 29.80;

Incidentally it is to be noted that the weather passed was of
0630 UTC. Detailed weather report of 1Gth August 1991 at differ-

55

ent polits of timie would appear from a Schedule annexed hereto

and marked with letter 'E’.

It is to be noted in the context of the crash taking place at
0716 UTC, the Tower ought to have transmitted even in the normal
circumstances the weather conditions at Imphal shorUy after 0700
UTC, more so when the Mcteorological Office as a matter of fact
has made available the 0700 weather conditions to the Tower
being inclement having 1/8 CB to the following effect:-

"290/04 kts; vis 7 Km; 3/8 800 (240M); 5/8 1800 ft.: 1/8 CB
3000f(900M); 8/8 10000 fL.(3000M) T 26; DP 23 QNH 1009 HPA;
29.80 INS QFE 919 HPA 27.14 INS; CB NE".

This weather, however, was above the operator's weather

niunima for an ILS approach at Imphal.

IC is perlinent to note here, however, that 0430 UTC meteoro-
logical report as was available with (he Flight Despateh of the
operator, categorically recorded thal the CB was existing over
huphal airport. Subsequent meteorological report al 0700 UTC
however, records lhe movement of CB in the north-easterly diree-
{lon and as such it can safely be concluded that the existence of
CB would not in any way affect the tight path of the aircralt as per
the flight plan which is from the South-West direction. In the
premises the affectation of the flight path by reason of existence of
CB does not and cannot arise. In any event, however, the ATCO in
my view ought to have transmitted the weather conditions immedi-
ately on receipt of the samme from the Meteorological office irrespec-
tive of the fact that Lhe same would not affect the flight path of the
aircraft. ICis the duty and an obligation on the part of iic AFCO to
inthnate all necessary informations to the pilots and non-conunu-
nication cannot but be termed to be a lapse on the part of the
ATCO though, however, it has 10 material bearing tanto (he cause of
the crash.

56

The CVR transcript, however, at 07:16:04 UTC records a
transinission from the Tower to the aircraft that the rain was ap-
proaching from the East and parl of the airficld was under rain.
The factum of such communication has also been noled by the
aircraft.

During the course of hearing, strenuous submissions have
been made by the operator mainly as also the ludiau Commercial
Pilots’ Association in regard to the existence of very severe upper
wind. The upper wind data, however, as obtained from the Mete-
orological Office negates such a contention. The record shows tor
(he month of August, 199] an upper wind in the region of 2 lo 12
knols al 5,000 feel level and between | to 8 knols al 10,000 [cel
level. The Meteorological Office in no uncertain terms stated that
this wind-measurement was effected by putting up balloons and
the measurements were Laken with a theodolite equipment. As
regards the upper wind data for 16th August, 1991, it has been
stated to be at 03 knots at 5,000 feet level at about 12:30 hrs. So
far as 10,000 fect level is concerned, no dala is available, but
considering the ground wind being at 4 knols at that time and 3
knots at 5,000 [cet level it cannot vary to an enormous extent and
itis obviously in the region of less than LO knots - though, howev-
cr, il is a presumption only.

Considering the above, in my view, however, that the upper
wind cannot possibly render any significant change in the flight
path of the aircraft during the lel down procedure. In this context
the evidence of Mr. James Kerrigan, being an Aeronautical Engi-
necr of the Boeing Company, Seattle Washinglon, ought to be
noted. Mr. Kerrigan has categorically stated that in spite ofa
variable wind between 5 to 20 knots, there shall not be much of a
difference in the Might path of the aircraft. Mr. Kerrigan has had
simulator exercises on the basis of this variable wind and pro-
duced the graph before the Court which as a imatter of fact corrob-
orales the statement as above. For convenience sake, the graph
produced by Mr. Kerrigan is annexed hereto and marked with
letter ‘F’.

8. AERODROME INFORMATION :

The coordinates of Uhe Imphal acrodrome are 24° 45° 49"
North, 93° 54° L1" East. It’s general clevation is 2536 feet but the
elevation of runway 04 ts 2532 feet above mean sea level. It has
one runway 04/22, and the runway 04 is, however, equipped with
Instrument Landing System (ILS). This runway 04 was intended

for Landing and has the following declared distances :-

(a) Take off run available is 9010 feet.

(b) Take off distance available Is 10378 leet.

(c) Landing distance available is 9010 feet.

(d) Accelerate stop distance available is 9210 tect.

(e) Runway 04 has cement concrete surface and Pavement
Classification Number (PCN) ts 28.

Unfortunately, this particular airport does not have any
recording devices so far as the transmission from the ground as
also from the aircraft are concerned. On the factual score a very
sorry slate of affairs appears lo be existing even this day. One ATC
mulli-channel tape recorder supped by Stencil Hotfinman of USA
was received at the Imphal Airport in early 1983. For a period of
four years no step whatsoever has been taken to have the seven
channel ATC tape-recorder conunissioned. As a imatter of fact as
appears from the Ietler dated 10th September, 1991 from National
Airports Authority to the Director General of Civil Avialion Wat the
recorder was installed in June 1987 but it could not, however, be
conunissioned for want of cerlain vilal components. 1 fail fo appre-
clale as to how a new equipment could not be comunissioucd for
want of certain vital components. The equipment supplied ought
to have been checked up by the appropriate authority at the initial
stages that some vilal parts are missing. Question of importation
of further required spares for the purpose of commissioning a new
equipment, in my view, does not arise. This is contrary to all
nonns of a commercial transaction and the supplier ought to have
been iitimated in regard thereto iumediately after the supply. For

58


.

four long years nobody sccms to have taken any notice of a costly
equipment. Adnitiedly it is a sophisticated electronic unil which
cannot possibly be performing well in the event not put to use for a
period of four years. Even after the detection that certain other
components are required, all concerned seem to be taking hings
very casily on the plea that DGTD is not giving any required clear -
ance and subsequent queries to the Indian agent as also foreign
suppller did not evoke any response - I am, however, nol prepared
to accept such a justification as has been given to the Director
Gencral of Civil Aviation by the National Airports Authority in
lermis of their letter noted above. When a Governmental agency
enters into a conunercial transaction with a foreign supplier, it
must act in a manner a commercial organisation is supposed to
act. The price has been paid and the equipment has been deliv-
ered, but no benefit has accrued to anyone - why this attitude - is
it because it is a Governmental property - if this be the case, then
it is high time that somebody should be told how commercial
transactions should be effected and the concerned department
should be properly oriented to meet such a situation. In fine |
have no other alternative but to record a totally sad stale of affairs
In regard to the dealings of a Governmental ageney. ‘Khe attitude
secs to be tolally indifferent which an organisation connected
with Civil Aviation cannot afford to have: human lives are ituvolved
and the Governmental agency is quile salisficd by simply writing a
letlcr that sleps are being taken to improve the whole situation. |
record my total dissatisfaction on to the whole situation in so far
as this aspect of the mailer under investigation is concerned.

The Aeronautical Information Circular (A.I.C.) 14 of 1984
dated 18 September 1984 issued by the Director General of Civil
Aviation, R.K.Puram, New Dellu records that the acrodrome is
surrounded by a number of hills and the height and direction of
different hills have not yet been determined. Subsequently howev-
er, upon the formation of the National Airports Authority, this
particular airport has been provided with Instrument Landing
System (ILS). Though in 1984, the details of obstructions lad not

59


been deternuned, obviously the National Airports Authority prior to
the Introduction of the ILS let down procedure lave been able to
detail out Uiese bills and other obstructions in the area in ques-
tion. It is to be noled that after preparation of ILS let down chart,
the same was sent to the operator, being Indian Airlines, for their
comments and the operator duly accepted (he same as being
otherwise safe. Needless to record here that the operator has been
operaling on the Instrument Landing System since 1987 at Imphal
Airport and at no point of time any objection has been raised by
the operator. As a matter of fact, during the course of hearing no
submission even has bee made by the operator in regard lo any
deficiency in the Instrument Landing System as per the let down
chart at the Imphal Airport. The ICPA (Ladian Comunerctal Pilot's
Association) however before this Court of Inquiry raised a doubt as
regards to the primary and secondary areas which according to
ICPA can not be termed to be safe opcralional areas as stipulated
by ICAO. It is to be noted here, that Shri S.A.Ram, Depuly Director
of N.A.A. and incharge of the preparation of the Instrument Let
Down Chart, in question, stated that there, in fact, exists a pri-
mary and a secondary area and the distance from VOR to ihe outer
tbnil of (he primary arca would be about 19 nautical mules and the
mit of the secondary area would be an additional 2.5 nautical
miles. Shri Ram has stated that secondary arca would extend
uplo 21.5 nautical miles from the VOR. While it is true that {he
pilots are never given any primary or secondary area chart, but
while preparing the let down chart some safety zone shall have to
be provided to cater for the error on the part of the pilots so that
the same may provide a cushion or a buffer. It is pertinent to note
that primary area provides for a clearance of 984 feet above the
highest obstruction wilhin the area and if one proceeds (hereafter
towards the ouler boundary of the secondary area, this clearance
of 984 [ect is progressively reduced to zero at the outer extremity of
the secondary area,

From the ILS let down chart it appears that the aircraft after
reporting overhead VOR at 10,000 feet should descend to 8,000

60


feet on the holding pattern itself and then proceed on to the out-
bound leg for 2 minutes 30 seconds from VOR upon a further
descent from 8,000 feet to 5,000 feet at the commencement of ihe
procedure turn with a speed not exceeding 170 nautical miles per
hour. The aircraft whilst on the procedure turn is supposed to
further reduce its height to 4,200 feet and upon capturing the
localiser to proceed inbound. Height of the aircraft shall have to be
al 4,020 feet at the outer marker inbound and then land with (he
assistance of the other landing aids available at the airport. It is
significant to note here that the Pilot-in-Comumand of the aircraft is
not aware of any primary or secondary arca but a strong adher-
ence to the Jet down chart is expected from the pilot. It is in evt-
dence that deviation from the let down chart is nol permitted tn
IFR flight. Safety of the aircraft on the basis of the let down chart
cannot be doubted in any manner whatsoever. Capt. Rahul in his
evidence categorically stated that the let down chart cannot be said
to be unsafe from any point of view. Though it is true that the
chart is not unsafe by any stretch but that does not, however,
mean and imply that ihe bufler or the cushion though intended at
the time of preparation of the let down chart shall not be existing
as a pracUcal reality. The primary and the secondary area oupht,
therefore, to be free of any obstruction or any material obstruction

considering the altitude, the aircraf( ts supposed to be in thal areca.

In the ILS let down chart it has been shown that there exists
an obstruction immediately before Une outer marker inbound ata
level of 3094 feet above sea level and considering the clevation of
the Imphal airport the obsiruction height is (o the extent of about
GOO feet. The ILS let down chart provides the ouler marker in-
bound level at 4,020 feet and considering the ICAO regulation of
obstruction free distance being 984 feet the let down chart can nol
be described to be unsafe in any manner. The importance of
obstruction free primary and secondary area however, can not be
decricd in any way bul since a doubt has been expressed in repard
to the same it would be better for all concerned to review the entire
Situation specially pertaining to tae North Eastern Region Airports

61


and also the hilly terrain airports in the country so as to provide
the necessary buffer to the aircraft in reality rather than in tem-
plates only. I wish to make tt quite clear that Unc let down chart is
quile safe and this is also the considered view of my Assessors, one
being an experienced Mller and other beiug a reputed engineer. The
view as above has also been corroborated by sentor officials of the

operator as well.

It Is lo be noted that C.T.E. of Ladian Alriines as carly as in
1989 did inform NLA.A. that the let down procedure is otherwise
salisfactory for normal ILS, Though however, in the meantime
they have suggested slight variation of the altitude at the outer
marker inbound level from 4,020 to 4,200 feet by reason of activa-
tion of G.P.W.S. on account of hill near outer-marker. But no post-
live objection has been taken in regard thereto. The suggestion is
merely on the basis of GPWS system and not otherwise a safety
requirement.

Considering, however, the importance and urgency of the
situation, this Court directed the DGCA and the National Airports
Authorily to review the whole situation even during (he pendcucy

of this investigation.

For convenience sake the ILS let down chart is detailed
hereunder :-

The ILS Iet down chart as noted above categorically points
oul that upon obtaining the glide slope at 4,020 feet, the pilot
should follow 035° heading and then land provided, however, the
runway is visible al 224 feet above the runway level. In the event,
however, the runway is not visible at the height mentioned above,
the aircraft is supposed to do a missed approach procedure and
climb straight ahead to 4,200 fect and then turn left to join the
VOR holding pattern al 8,000 feet. Similar provision has been
made in the chart in the event of the glide slope or the middle
marker being not available, the aircraft in Unat event, however,
cannot land unless the runway Is visible from an height of 317 {cet
and the aircraft is to carry a missed approach procedure as noted
above. The procedure laid down is elaborate and if followed ques-
tion of the let down chart being unsafe does not and cannot arise.

The distance between VOR and the outer marker is around 6
nautical miles. From outer marker to the farthest point on proce-
dure turn the distance would be around another 5 nautical miles
and calculating the total distance, therefore, it comes to around 11
nautical miles from VOR. Obstruction if any admittedly is at 17.3
nautical miles at an allitude of 4,265 fect. There is, therefore, a
cushioning area of 6 nautical miles for the aircraft to obtain ILS

assistance and land at Imphal Airport presently.

Mr. Ram has stated that at an indicated specd of 170 knols
and having taken into account statistical wind of 15 knots together
with an additional 10 knots the aircraft can fly otherwise very
safely for 166 seconds outbound from VOR. In accordance with
the chart, the aircraft is not supposed to fly more than 150 sec-
onds. Therefore, total cushioning flying area ts to the extent of 16
scconds, which cannot by any strcteh be termed to be low for sale
distance. As a matter of fact, this cannol be said to be unsate at
all. Thus, from whichever point of view the chart ts looked Upon,
namely, cither from distance-wise or from fiviag: ine-wise there is
sufficient cushioning even at this stage in so far as the let down
chart is concerned.

64

Turning back on to ihe evidence tendered before the Court, i
{s secu that Capt. Rahut himself has subinitted that GO nautical
niles tail wind will drift the aircraft forward maximum to the
extent of 2.5 miles beyond the farthest point of procedure (urn and
in the event of farihest point of procedure turn is treated as 11
nautical miles then in that event at best it can come upto 13.5
nauucal infles aud not beyond that. Assuming a further cushion.
ing zone of 2.5 nautical miles is added thereon, the distance there-
fore comes upto 16 nautical miles. It, therefore, appears that there
ought not to be any difficulty experienced by the pilot even if there
exists a tail wind speed of GO nautical miles provided there is due
adherence to the let down procedure. It is, however, placed on
record that the tail wind of GO nautical miles does not have any
corroborative documentary evidence since the Meteorological
report has recorded maximum upper wind at 5,000 feet as 3 knols
on 16th August, 1991. It is however, placed on record that accord-
tug to the Director Aviation Services, Mr. L.K. Murthy "The esti-
mated 0600 UTC wind on 16.8.1991 at Imphal at 3.1 Kins. is
120/10 kts."

In that view of the matter (he question of existence of ob-
struction in the primary area being the cause of the accident dues
nol arise. The answer to the inquiry nanicly can this aircraft by
reason of 60 nautical miles tail wind drift to the crash site cannot.
therefore, but be in the negative.

9. NAVIGATIONAL AIDS AT IMPHAL AIRPORT :

The Inspector of Accidents reports that there exists followhig

Navigalion and landing facilites at lmphal airport :

“(a) Instrument Landing System (ILS) comprising of Local-
izer, GUde Path, Middie Marker & Outer Marker.

(b) Very High Frequency Onun-Direetlonal Radio Range
(VOR).

(c) Non-Directional Beacon (NDB).

Itinay be mentioned that no Locator Beacon is in-
stalled either at Middle Marker or Outer Marker.

Also no DME is installed with the VOR at this acro-
drome, It is understood from National Airports Au-
thority (NAA) that DME equipment was received at
limphal in July, 1991. Its installation is Hkely to be
taken up In early October (1991) and is assessed to be
completed towards the end of November 1991. Subse-
quently, llowever, the Inspector of Accident reported to
this court by way of a letter dated 5th December,
1991, that the DME has already been tustalled and
has become operaUonal on and since 291h November,
1991.

Instrument Landing System:

The Instrument Landing System enables the pilot of an
aircraft to make a sale approach and landing ona
rullway even under adverse weather and visibility
condition. The system provides azimuth guidance,
elevation guidance and distance from threshiold infor.
mation.

(i) Function of components of ILS :

{a) Localizer :

The Localizer provides lateral guidance or azimuth
guidance and enables the pilot to align the aircraft
with the centre Hne of the Tunway. Localizer coverage
is provided up to a distance of 25 NM within 10° on
either side of exlended centre Hne of the runway anda
distance of 17 NM within 35°.

(b) Glide Path :

The Gide Path provides elevation guidance, due to
which aircraft is able to descend along pre-detcrimined

path during landing. The normal glide angle is 2° to
4°. lt provides coverage upto 10 NM within a sector of
8* in the direction of approach.

Outer & Middle Marker :

The Outer and Middle Markers, located at specified
distatice from (he runway along with the approach
path, provide information to the pilot regarding post-
tion of the aircraft with reference to runway threshold.

Monitors :

These componcuts of ILS are provided with their asso-
ctaled moniloring remote control and status indication
system. Montloring system keeps under cheek the
performance of the equipment and in case of malfunc-
Uoning, switches over to standby equipment. In case,
standby equipment also does not perform within speci-
fled tolerance the facility is au tomatically shut down.
Remote control and status indicator system facilitates
i switching ON/OFF from a remote location as well as
to know the status of serviceabilily of the facilities.

As per ICAO requirement, rouline flight checks on ILS
should be carried out ouce i 90+ 15 days.

Imphal ILS Equipment & Installation -

ILS system at huphal conuiprises of Locailzer, GUde
Path, Middle and Outer Markers. These facittiies were
conmuussioned in February, L987 and were last figlit
tested on 5.6.1991 and operational status of all the
components of ILS was declared unrestricted.

Localizer :

Localizer G.C.L. 721 was Manufactured by Gujrat
Communication and Electronics Ltd. The Localizer
equipment consist of main and standby channels
installed in an equipment room at the airport. The
Localizer is installed al the end of runway 04 at
Imphal. These Trausmitlers function on electrical
cnergy supplied by baltery on trickle charge. In case
of power supply fatlure, standby generators supply
power. If generator fails, the batteries comlinue to feed
transnutter tor approx. four hours. The transmilters
are installed in alr-condittioned room located in opera-
onal area at the airport. One fransmilter works at a
Hime and other is slandby. The signuats from equip-
ment ts raclated by aerlal assemib y installed at he
stop end of runway 04,

The transmitted beam covers 35° on elther side of
centre line of runway 04. Localizev range is 25 NM

within + LO° from the beginning of the runway. Fur-
ier clearance signal is also generated which gives
pilots indication of the vicinity of the aircraft from the
extended centre line of the runway when alreralt
comes willhin 35°. The range of this clearance signal ts
about 75% of ihe course Signal. The vertical coverage
of the Localizer Beam signal is 7.5°. The radiated
Signal is coustantly monitored and its accuracy Is
automatically checked through monitors fustalled in
the equipment cabinet.

Glide Path :

The Glide Path equipment, type GCL 741, manutac-
tured by Gujrat Conununication & Electronics Lid.,
comprises of two (ransuiltters installed in au alr -condl-
loned equipment room. Like Localizer, one transnul-
ter is the main and other is standby. Power supply to
Glide Path Transmitters Is siuular to the already stated

‘earlier tn case of Localizer Trausumitlers. One trans.

nutter works at a time. The Glide Path facility provides
elevation information to the aircraft at an assured
distance of 1O NM. The normal Glide Path angle at
Imphal is 3°. The radiation pattern is So adjusted that
it gives a sector width from -0.39to + 1.759in vertical
direction where @1s the Prescribed descend angle.
This signal is available within + 8° with respect to
extended centre line In horizontal Plane wile the
aircraft descends to glide angle and Maiutain the
correct position on Localizer.

The racated signal from GHde Path system ts conUnu-
ously monitorec by near field moullors. In case of out
of tolerance signal radiated main transmitter will
automatically shut down and Standby start functlon-
ing. In case of radiation of out of lolerance Signal by
standby transmitter, the monitors will shut down
standby transmitter also.

As per pre-determined and published approach proce-
dure for ILS at Imphal, the aircraft is expected to
report over VOR (Airport at a height of 10,000 ft.) and
then ina holding pattern descend to 8000 ft. and then
89 oulbound parallel io the extended centre line of the
rulway ata bearing of 217° (VOR) upto 2.5 mts. at
170 Kis. ina descending phase (8000 ft. to 5000 ft.)
Then the atreratt Imdates the Procedure turn, Curninags
left to 172° and then mga lo 352". In this process, the
pilot descends from 5000 ft. to 4200 ft. above mean
Sea level (AMSL). While Vurandaags Inbound, he is expect
ed to pet the Localizer beaut and follow (he sane unit
lic is "on Localizer". ‘The Pilot then captures plide path
and starts descending and gets glide path signal. ‘the
pilot will cross the Outer Marker at 4020 ft. AMSL.

68

The arrangement of moidtors and remote control for
Glide Path is identical with the Localizer described
above.

(c) Outer Marker :

This facility is located at a distance of 4.5 NM froim the
threshold of runway 04. Tlius facilily is uscd as check
point while aircraft makes ILS approach.

Audio-visual signals will be received by the aireralt
while over the Ouler Marker, the duration of which,
when exactly aligned to the centre Hne of the runway,
varies between 6 to 13 seconds. The height of the
aircrafl overhead Ouler Marker should be 4020 [t.
AMSL at Huphal.

(d) Middle Marker :
This facility idenUcal to Ouler Marker except {t Is
located at a distance of 0.7 NM from the threshold of
runway 04 and the expected height of the aircraft over
Middle Marker is 2815 ft. AMSL.

(e) Remote/Status Indication :

Remote tndteation/control is available in the equip-
ment room on the ground floor of the Control Tower
Building. The indications are in the form of red and
preen lights. It shows the particular transmitter of
socalizer/Gide Path cmiitthag at any moment. Similar
fidicaltons are avallable for monitors.

As per ICAO Annex-10, acrodrome Control Tower and
Units providing approach control service should be
provided without delay with information on the opera-
Uonal status of Radio Navigation Aids essential for
approach, landing and take off at the aerodrome(s)
with which they are concerned.

However, soon after the accident status indication
lights in the Control Tower at Imphal were found
unserviceable",

ILS at Imphal:

Inspector of Accident further reports that on the day of
accident, all Navigational Alds at Imphal acrodrome were service-
able. As per recounnendation by ICAQ, Hight inspection of ILS ts
required at 90 days + 15 days interval. As per records, last period-

ic calibration check of ILS was carried out on 5.6.199 1.

69

After Uae accident a special (ght cleck of ILS was carried
oul on 18.8.1991 to ascertain its operalional status. Except for
course line alignment of Localizer all other paraineters of Localizer
and Glide Path were within limits.

In case of Markers except for higher duration of Markers

Indication, all olher parameters were also within Units.

FLIGHT UNDERTAKEN TO LOCATE CRASII SITE WITH RE-
SPECT TO IMPHAL VOR

The Inspector of accident reported that a Hight was carried
out on 19.8.1991 by Dornier aircraft of National Alrports Authority,
normally used for calibration (ight. During this [light, the average
time worked out from the Outer Marker to crash site and back at
an altitude of 8000 [t. ala noniunal JAS of 170 Kts. was 4 mis. 46
seconds. The crash site was found to be at a distance of 20.5 NM
from VOR on radial 220°.

While it Is true that the Inspector of Accidents reported that
the distance belween crash stile and the VOR Imphal to be 20.5
NM, some doubt was expressed as to the correctness of the same
by reason wherefor I had to undertake a special joureny to
Guwahali for Une pupose of ascertafiment of correct distance, but
by reason of bad weather condilions prevatling at Imphal, no
success could be achived as more fully detailed under the chapter
on ‘General Outline of Investigation by the Court of Inquiry’. IL
would however be convienient to note at this juncture that a fur-
ther atlempt was made by the Court to ascertain the sane by
directing (he Director General of Civil AviaUon to obtain the neces-
sary coordinates of Thangjing Hill and the distance from the top of
the hit to (he VOR Imphal to be cerlilied by the Surveyor General
of India in pursuance whereof the Depuly Director Tech. for the
Director Survey (AIR) in the Directorate of Survey intimated the

70


Director General of Civil Aviation the coordinates of top of Thang}-

ing Hill to be as follows :-
THANGJING (1915 M)

Latitude 24° 30° 12" N
Longitude 93° 40° 35" E

The VOR hnphal coordinates being

Latitude 24° 46° 01" N
Longitude 93° 54’ 28" E

and on the basis of the above the distance between the above
noted two points was certified to be 20.19 NM approximately. It is
also to be noled that subsequent to the receipt of the above tnfor-
imation, the Court also had it confirmed by a letter dated 27th
March, 1992.

VOR at Imphal:

VOR facililics at Imphal is being provided by ulilising the
equipment WILCOX 476A, which was conunissioned in September
1977. The facility was flight tested on 4.6.199] and ils operational
status was declared unrestricted. The VOR at Imphal operaies on
frequency 116.9 MHz with identification code IIM.

Perusal of records indicated that VOR maintenance person-
nel al fmphal were taking meter readings of the equipment perlodi-
cally and also was carrying monthly ground checks. It has been
seen from the cquipment log book that on 16.8.1991 VOR at
lmphal was working satisfactorily at the tine of accident of Indian
Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft.

This VOR facility was flight inspected afler the accident on
18.8.1991 to ascertain ils status. During this Might check all

71


parameters of Transimitter-1 and Il were within specified linuts
expect 30 Hz. Reference level of Transmilter-1 was high (actual
reading 17.6 against the Umit of 15 to 17). During the time of
accident Transmiltter-Il of VOR was in operation on 16.8.1991.

Regarding flight inspection of VOR and ILS at Imphal under-
taken by Flight Inspection Unit of NAA on 18.8.1991 (after the
accident) it was confirmed by NAA that "VOR - all parameters have
been found to be within defined limits. VOR Tx.2 which was in
opcralion of 16.8.1991 VOR let down procedure checked and {ly-
able.

ILS - Tx.1 of localizer and Tx.1 of glide path were in opera-
lion on 16.8.1991. Except for the course line alignment of localiz-
er, all other parameters of localizer and glide path were within
limits. Localizer course Une was oul by 21.9 UA against ICAO
specification of 15 UA for the same". DGCA representative was on
board for these flighis.

Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) :

One of the most debated issucs before the Court of Inquiry is
in regard to the non-availability of Distance Measuring Equipmeut
(DME) at Imphal Airport. Whereas the operator along with the
ICPA submitted that in the event of there being a DME, this par-
licular accident would not have taken place as the equipment is
the only instrument from which the pilot is in a position to know
his distance from a particular fix at any airport.

Admittedly and there is no manner of doubt that DME is a
very useful navifational aid and is of very preal assistance lo the
pilot in measuring his distance from VOR or ILS as the case may
be. But the issue arises whether non-availability of DME can be
ascribed to be the cause of ihe aceident or even contributed to the
accident. Before recording my own finding in regard thereto the
evidence tendered before the Court ought to be considered.

72

Mr. S.K. Rastogi, Senlor Acrodrome Officer, Incharge Imphal
Airport, has stated that a DME is useful both for the pilots as well
as for the Control Tower for the purpose of finding distance from
the aircraft to the runway. Incidentally it is to be noted that all
Boeing aircraft are fitted with a DME to correspond with a match-
ing ground cquipinent. Mr. Rastogi, however, stated hat in the
abscuce of a DME there ought not lo be any difficulty in the matter
of measurement of a distance though by an indirect method. Mr.
Rastogi explained the method being based on the ground speed
aud the distance from stations ‘A’ to "Lin colmparison with time.
Though however, he has clearly admitted that this measurement
would be by estimation only and which niay differ by one or two
nautical miles at best, it is the definite statement of Mr. Rastogi
that apart from this estimation the pilot is getling certain other
navigational aids enroute like VOR from where he can take his
position and be more accurate as to how much time he should
take therefrom. It is on evidence that by comparing the previous
reporting position and ihe time one can casily make out the dis-
tance he shall have to cover. In general Mr. Rastogi's evidence is to
the effect that there ought not to be any difficully in the matter of
safe arrival of the aircraft at a particular airfield even without
having a Distance Measuring Equipment though it is very much
desirable to have such an equipment at the station since it can
give the distance without any further calculation. Mr. Rastogi
further stated (hal in the event of disorientation of the pilot, the
DME would be of very great assistance.

Capt. Mehta when asked specifically aboul the importance
and usefulness of this particular equipment, categorically stated
that DME does not form part of the standard ILS procedure bul if
it is available it will definitely help. According to him DME can be
termed to be an additional assistance to the pilot. Capt. Mehta
agrecd with the view that there are olfher ground aids available at
the lmphal airport and the pilot can very easily navigate the air-
crall provided of course he follows aud adheres to the laid down

73


procedures. Capt. A. Raliut also has stated that DME is a helpful
guide.

Mr. Satendra Singh has also stated that DME would be an
extremely helpful guide though cannot be termed to be a very

essential requirement.

The evidence so far disclosed before the Court, therefore,
leaves no manner of doubt that the DME Js a helpful navigational
aid, but cannot be termed to be an essential navigational aid since
in the event of there being no DME, the pilot can co-relate his
distance from the earlier reporting point as also from overhead
VOR by calculation on timings. Incidentally, it is to be noted that
the pilot has been given the let down chart of ILS on the basis of
Umings and speed and not on the basis of a distance. It is a lime-
oriented chart and not a distance-orlented one. The factum of
Ume-orientation is fully within the knowledge of the pilots who fly
into Imphal. It is to be noted further (hat there are approximately
on al average two flighis a day to Imphal and the pilots have been

operaling Uncre without DME for the last several years.

This observation of mine ought not to be interpreted as
undermining the importance and the assistance rendered by DME.
I wish to clarify that abscuce of DME cannot be termed to be the
cause of the accident since even without DME safe landing is
otherwise possible with the assistance of other navigational and
landing aids at Imphal Airport.

Let us ow consider the converse situation also: this parucu-
lar pilot Capt. Sekhar Halder immediately after crossing overhead
Comilla has been giving wrong call-outs both in regard to alli-
tude and distance as more fully appear from the CVR/FDR co-
relation note above. The front panel instrument would definitely
give an indication as to whether he was overhead VOR or not. The
pilot unfortunately did not even bother to proceed on the basis of
the panel instruments - had he followed the same, question of this

74

inquiry would not have arisen. There is not only non-adherence to
the ILS let down chart but a total disregard of the frout panet
instruments - where Is the guarantee, though may be a presump-
tion, that the pilot would have adhered to the DME even if that was
available. I have no hesitation to record thal the entire course of
conduct of the pilot after the aircraft has left overhead Comilla is
rather slip shod and a total disregard for all normal procedures
which a pilot is supposed to follow. It is to be further recorded that
the CVR transcript does not show any emergency of any nature
being experienced by the pilots at the cockpit. The attitude is as
appears from the CVR transcript one of total cool and as stated by
Capt. M.V.V. Rao as a copy-book transmission which when co-
related with FDR depicts otherwise. As a maller of fact Capt. Rao
lumself has stated that he would not have given him the conunand
licence if this FDR was inade available to him after his coumand
check. Iam indeed sorry to record (he same but tulortunately |
am rather helpless considering the facts of the matter under inves-
tigalion. Obviously, a sense of complacency has developed which
has prompted the pilot to proceed in a manner as he has done
while operating the flight from Calcutta to Imphal on the fateful
day.

The other aspect of the matter ought not also to be lost sight
of since a Distance Measuring Equipment was received adnuttedly
at Imphal in July, 1991. In the normal course of events, one
would expect that an equipment costing about rupees one crore
would be immediately comunissioned but this particular equipment
has been allowed to remain at the airport in an unpacked condi-
tion al least till after the accident - a situation which cannot by
any stretch be said to be warranted.

Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) - AD 200 :

During the course of hearing, both Capt. Bagchi appearing
for the Indian Air Passengers Association and Capt. Mulherkar
appearing for Indian Commercial Pilots’ Association, in no uncer-
lain terms suggested that if AD 200 was available wiih (he lmphat

75


Air Traffic Control, the Controller would have known the direction

of the aircraft and thereby could have saved the accident,

AD-200 is a VDF equipment and {{s usefulness cannot in
any way be decried, but with the advancement of technological and
scientific instrumentation of navigational aids, the absence of AD-
200s is not felt in the same way as it used to be about a decade
ago. The installation of VOR at the Indian airports has done away
with the use of the AD-200s in this country. Admittedly, flying in
these days has become totally pilot-oriented. AD-200 would not in
any way assist the pilot on board the aircraft but it is a ground
equipment through which the Controller can identify the direction
of the aircraft and considering therefore the recent pilot-orlented
approach, the National Airports Authority thought it fit to replace
the AD-200s by installation of VORs.

[t is placed on record that I had the painful duty of investi-
galing another air accident involving an F-27 aircraft (VT-DMC)
belonging to Vayudoot on 19th October, 1988 near Guwahali,
Assai. In course of that investigalion also the issue was raised
and when asked the then Coordinating Director Mr. Tekchandani
submitted a brief nole which was quoted al page 80 of the Report.
For convenience sake the same is also quoted hereinbelow :-

"The AD-200 model of VDF equipment was available at
many aerodromes in this country till around
1978/1980. The equipment in use had been serving
at these airfields for over three decades and it had
become increasingly difficult to maintain these equip-
ments in serviceable condition because of the ageing of
the equipment and non-availability of spare parts due
to obsolescence. After carefw consideration of various
aspects Including maintainability of the equipment
upto prescribed standards, their necessity vis-a-vis the
availability of more advanced Nav aids Uke VOR, the
then DGCA decided to withdraw these equipment

radually from service. AD-200C, a later version of

D-200 was ithe last to be withdrawn from service in
this Region at Bhubaneswar some time in 1988 when
i( was no longer possible to maintain the facility to
desired standards.

76

On the queslion of its replacement by latest version, I
would like to submit thal the sanie was not considered
necessary because the VOR, considered an advanced
pilol interpreted and more versatile aid has been
provided at most of the airporis and the NAA is in the
process of providing more VOR coverage of the Indian
alr space. Obvious advantage of tie VOR over the AD-
200 as a direction {lnder Hes in the fact that the pilot
can have its bearing with reference to the VOR tuned
by him from the appropriate instrument in the cockpit
coutinuously, whereas itt the case of AD-200 the bear-
ing of the aircraft derived alt the ground had to be
comununicated by the Air Traffic Control to the aircraft
whenever desired or necessary. The only advantage of
AD-200 over VOR, if it can be so termed, lies in the
fact that the ATC would know the direction of the
aircraft in the case of AD-200 and not in the case of
VOR which is a pilot interpreted aid.

I may also add that the latest generation of VDF
equipment of the type in use at four international
airports (imported from USA manufactured by Servo
Corporation) ts not indigenously available and that it is
a costly equipment. :

Cousidering the huge cost involved in providing the
VDF equipment at all (he airports in the country par-
ticularly in hard foreign currency, {| would be apprect-
ated by His Lordship and the Learned Assessors that
NAA can go for this only at the cost of ils present plans
to improve and modernise the communication and
Navigational aids in more crucial areas."

The findings on this particular issue so far as the earlter
investigalion is concerned ought also to be noted. At page 81 of
the earlier reporl my observations to the following cffect were
recorded :-

"While it is true thal AD-200 is an out-dated machin-
ery, but its importance and usefulness cannot be
decried. But considering the improved phenomenon of
the ground aids, in my view, it would not be fair to put
any blame on to the National Airports Authority as was
sought to have been done by various parties appearing
before the Court of Inquiry. With the AD-200, the
ground control is in a position to know the location of
the aircraft and in the earlicr days used to communi-
cate the same to the aireraft, but with the introduction
of VOR, the same being now considered to be a pilot
interpreted instrument and a more effective aid so that
the pilot-in-command himself is ina position to locate
his locations rather than depending upon the ground

77


control to inform him. In that view of the matter,
installation of further AD-200s on the threshold of the
21st century, in my view, does not warrant further
consideration aud Faceept the submissions made by
Mr. Tekchandani ou behalf of the National Airports
Authority."

In the present context also since there is no new material on
record or any additional evidence being adduced before the Court
justifying a different view, I do not intend to retract from the earlier
observations, but reiterate the same and note that with the ad-
vancement of technology question of introduction of AD-200 al this
Stage docs not arise. It is nol a replacement for a radar though a
definite land aid which has lost its importance in the present day

context.
Locator Beacons :

As narrated above the Instrument Landing System caters for
the existence of an outer marker signal - it may be through a fan
marker and a locator beacon or only a fan marker. Whereas the
fan marker has a limited vertical range with a cone over which it
provides audio and visual indications, the locator beacon Is a non-
directional beacon having a much wider range and would thus be a
lore positive assistance to the pilot in the matter of locating his
position vis-a-vis the outer marker. The locator beacon will indi-
cate as to the direction of the outer marker so as to allow the pilot
lo take correclive measures if there be any. Locator beacon is an
addiUonal assistance but cannot as such be termed to be an
essential navigational equipment in an ILS procedure. Needless to
say, however, that existeuce of a fan marker will suffice in so far as
the safety aspect is concerned, more so by reason of the fact that
the pilot is supposed to follow the procedure in ils observance
ralher than in its deviations. At the lnphal Airport, there is a fan
marker which gives both audio and the light blip and that by itself,
in iy view, would be a sufficient protecHon lo (he pilot for a sale
landing. As noted above, locator beacon is an addilional assist-
ance and il is always better to have a further assistance if that is

78

1 be

available. Locator beacon is nothing but a low powered NDB
through which the pilots are ina position to locate the outer
inarker with exactitude. tt cannot thus, (therefore, be regarded as a
mandatory essential navigational ald but an additional assistance.
It is on record that on the fateful day the fan markers at the outer
marker and the middle marker locations duly emitted both audio
and visual signals even just before the unfortunate crash as re-
ported by Capt. L.P. Mishra being the Pilot-in-Commanid of fight
IC-889 on 16th August, 1991. For convenience sake relevant
extract of his statement is quoted hereinbelow :-

“While operating flight IC-889 (Guwahati-lmphal) we
approached Imphal on radial 282 (102° tnbound) we
were cleared to FL 100 and we checked overhead and
proceeded outbound on 217° directly as it was not
possible to join the hold as there was a cell. We did a
normal L/D VOR and ILS landed nornially. Naviga-
lional Aids at that time were functioning normal.
Outer Marker (fan marker) we received both Audio and
Visual signals besides we also monitored the L/D
down on our ND/(Navigation Display)."

Capt. K. Patel, Commander of flight IC-255/256 on 16th
August, 1991, landed at finphal at about 1205 hrs. approximately,
did nol also report the non-availabilily of the outer marker Signals.
For convenience sake, the relevant extract from the statement of

Capt. Patel is noted hereinbelow :-

"I operated IC-255 Caicutta-Silchar-lmphal in morning
departure was about 0G15 hrs. in morning. When we
approach overhead Silchar visibilily at Sitchar dropped
lo [000M with rain and low clouds. As weather was
below our minima, I diverted to Imphal which reported
7 kms. visibility and light drizzle. E carried oul VOR
ILS procedure and landed at Imphal. Weather was low
clouds and visibility 7 kms. We sighted runway at
about Outer Marker. Navigation aids at (his time was
working normal. After approximately 1 hour 45
minutes when Siicher {improved we continued our
flight to Silchar and linphal. Second time when we
landed at Imphal weather given was 5000 mirs. and
sky was overcast. I carried oul VOR ILS and again
sighted runway on Outer Marker. All navigational aids
were working normally. For both the ILS approaches
at Imphal I have reported overhead VOR at 10000 feet
and join the hold to descend to 8000 feet and procced

79

to outbound descending to 5000 Icet and then descend
to 4200 feet in procedure turn.

Even if the conditions are VFR, I will carry out VOR
ILS procedure, keeping in view the terrain in the vicini-
ty of the airport.........

While on ILS we cross check our height over outer
marker 4,020 feel by audio and visual signal of marker
(inbound)."

Incidentally, it is to be noted that iminediately afler the
crash the particular channel of the ILS was sealed and the system
was calibrated in the morning of 18th August, 1991 by the Nation-
al Airports Authority with a representative of Director General of
Civil Avialion on board the calibration aircralt. The calibration re
sults depict that "on that day the transmitter (1) of the localizer
and transniilter (1) of the glide path were in operation. Post acci-
dent calibration was carried out on 18th Aug. 1991. Except for the
course line alignment of the localizer, all other parameters of the
localizer and glide path were within limits."

From the report of the Shri K.V.N. Murthy, Executive Diree-
tor, National Airports Authority, it appears that though there is
slight deviation in the course line alignment of the localizer but the
deviaion is not to such an extent so as to alter the flight path of
the aircraft since the deviation is lo Lhe extent of about 50 feet
only. The glide path as noted above in the report, is in operation
and there is no other infirmity in the equipments. tn order (o
appreciate, however, the slight deviation in the course line align-
ment of localizer, | have had a discussion with Mr. K.V.N. Murthy,
Exccutive Director (IP), the Nalional Airports Authority and | did
ask him to subnift a report in regard thereto. For convenieuce
sake, the same is set out hereinbelow :-

"The Flight Inspection Reports Nos. 16GO0 & 1G60A
indicate a course alignment of 21.9 micro amp. for
both Transmilter 1 and Transmitter 2 of the Localiser
at Imphal. This indicates that the course line informa-
tion observed at the landing threshold would be dis-
placed by 51.1 {cet i.e. if the pilot follows the Localiser
centre-line information, he would find himself 51.5 feet

80

away from the actual centre Une of the licaliser at the
threshold. As per ICAO, the permissible lint for such
a displacement is $5 leet for Cat. Tsystems. This
displacement was corrected by subsequent mainte-
nance and correct adjustment confirmed by Flight
Inspection Report No. 1662.

The Flight Inspection Reports mentioned above,

- however, indicate that the structure of the localiser
course to be well within tolerance i.e. there were no
beuds in the localiser beam."

The calibration report of the National Airports Authority is
also annexed hereto and marked with Ietter 'G'.

10. SEARCH AND RESCUE :

The luispector of Accidculs Mr. RAK. Paul, who visited the

crash site, in his report has slated as follows :-

"Afler duly ATCO Mr. Sen Gupta failed to establish
contact with IC-257, he informed Shri S.K. Rastogi,
Senior Acrodrome Officer (SAO) incharge of the acro-
drome who immediately came and took over control
and initiated different phases of emergency procedure.
Several calls were given to IC-257. Also IC-890 and
IC-256 (on ground at limphal) called IC-257 but there
was ho response.

At 1248 hrs. IST Fire Station was alerted to keepa
look out for IC-257. ludian Airlines was also informed
and advised to contact I1C-257 on their comlpatly
channel.

1C-890 which was just airborne, was requested lo
proceed about LO/12 miles south-west of hill at
10,000 feet to find oul IC-257. But duc to cloud it was
not possible to look out for IC-257 and this aircraft
then set course for Guwahatt. In the meantime, blind
calls were given lo IC-257 stating that it was cleared to
land on runway 04 (considering conununication fail-
ure).

It was delermined from Indian Airlines that there were
62+1 passengers on board. At 1255 hrs. IST full
emergency was declared. Fire station was advised
accordingly with instructions to position their crash
fire tender etc. to handle IC-257. City Fire
Brigade/S.P. Fire, lmphal were contacted and request-
ed to keep their crash tender ready for assistance.
Deputy Comunissioner & Supdi. of Police, Imphal were
(hen informed aboul the missing aircraft on (he (nal
approach and requested lo intimate D.C./S.P., Bish-
nupur District which falls on the final approach path
siice the aircraft ts Hkely fo be found in that area,

Guwahati and Calculta were informed through
HF/R.T. Regional Medical College and Ambulance
Services and S.P. (CID) were informed. By 1305 IST all
these agencics had been informed.

D.C. Imphal contacted to know the position of the
aircraft and he was advised to organise search and
rescue within or exceeding 5-15 miles south-West of
the airport.

82

IC-256 which was cleared for departure al. 1310 IST,
was advised to search for IC-257, but duc to cloud, he
flew for aboul 5/6 minutes withoul any success and
then sel course for Silchar.

By 1330 hrs. IST Senior Aerodrome Officer (SAO)
constituted Search and Rescue party. In the mean-
time, SAO also instructed acrodrome office to inform
Delhi Hqrs., Chief Secretary, Joint Secretary (Ho:me),
Mauipur regarding the situation.

1.G. Police and S.P. Implal came to airport at 1335
hrs. IST and were briefed about (he situation and also
informed that the aerodrome scarch and rescue party
was leaving for probable crash site towards Motrang.
Search and Rescue Party started from airport at 1350
hrs. IST and reached the Office of the d-C. Bishnupur
around 1600 hrs. On reaching the office of the d.C.
Bishnupur, it was learnt that D.C./S.P. have left
towards Molrang along with rescue team. The acro-
drome search add rescue party came back to airport at
1650 hrs. IST. At 1658 hrs. IST it was learnt from
Slate Authority that some villagers had informed thal
(he alreraft had crashed at Thang}ing bith just about
22 NM from the aerodrome. The message was relayed
to Guwahali and Calcutta. However, SAO contaciced
1D-C. Imphal about this message bul was told that the
authenticity of Uc message could be verified only after
the rescue team reaches the site which would take
about 5/6 hours due to very difficult terrain.

While search and rescue was being organised, S.P.,
Churachandpur, Mr. K.H. Netra received information
around 1430 hrs. IST re arding the crash of I.A.
Boeing aircraft through police radio control. He was
asked to organise search party for locating the missing
aircraft.

Mr. Netra pol information around 1720 hes. from
S.D.P.0., Churachandpur that oue villager reported to
Molrang Police Station about one aircralt crashed at
Thanging hill range. He along with his men, therefore,
proceeded (o the crash sile. It was heavily ratutng and
alinost dark al that ime. ‘they could reach to Than i-
ing hill around 22:30 hrs. IST which is under the
jurisdiction of Churachandpur. ‘They saw one dead
body and also experienced smell of burning oil. While
proceeding further, they found more dead bodies and
finally located the site. He found the aircraft was
broken to pieces with dead bodies around it. There
was no fire but smoke was emilling. He ascertained
that ihere was no survivors.

Due to difficull terrain, heavy rain and dark night, he
along with police force waited till dawn.

83


S.P. Churachandpur stated that 12 bodies were
evacuated on 17.8. 1991, 40 bodies on 18.8. 1909T and
remaining £7 bodes on 19.8.1991. On completion of
(he rescue work, all the bodies were brought down to
the base camp at the foot hill by road wilh the help of
police, B.S.F and other para-nulitary forces and volun-
tary organisalions. Finally, on compiction of the
rescue work, S.P. left the crash site after arranging to
guard the place. The rescue work was also assisted by
aupur Rifle, B.S.F. and S.R.P.F.

Regional Controller of Air Safety, Calcutta and Senior
Air Safety Officer (Ops.) were informed by Deputy
Director Aerodrome, Shri G. Sarkar about this nussing
aircraft at around 1315 hrs. IST on 16.8.1991. Both
of them immediately arrived at the search and rescue
centre of Calcutta Airport. Information about locatin
the aircraft on Thangjing hill was received at Calcutta
at around 17:00 hrs IST.

Honourable Minister for Civil Aviation, Secretary - Civil
Aviation, Director General of Civil Aviation, Deputy
Director General and Director of Air Safely arrived
Calcutta at night and on next morning they ail left in a
special aircraft for Imphal. RCAS and SASO (Ops.)
also arrived Imphal by the same aircrafl. By the time
the rescue operation was in full swing. As per the
inforination received from the Police Control at around
1700 hrs. on 17.8.1991, 52 bodies were recovered out
of which 12 were identified. By 19.8.1991, all bodics
were recovered and identified.

Crash site was on difficult hilly terrain about 6700 feet
ASL. Also due to inclement weather and difficult ter-
rain rescue operation became very difficult task."

This Court, however, is not in a position to appreciate the
role of the Naional Airports Authority in the matter of Search and
Rescue. Mr. Rastogi, Senior Acrodronic Officer, and an official of
National Airports Authorily fn no uncertain terms has stated (hat
in the event of there being an air crash in the vicinity of the airport
only ihe National Airports Authority is expected to take steps for
search and rescue but not otherwise since that would be the
responsibility of the State Government. I am to record here my
tolal disagreement with this practice of the National Airports
Authority. The National Airports Authority is one of the principle
wings of the entire Civil Aviation industry in this country and it is
truce that their functions are specified but thal, however, does not

84


mican and imply that there shall not be any obligation on their part
to be a party in the matter of search aud rescue in an air crash,
even Hf the crash takes place ata place which caunot be said to be
within the vicinily of Une airporl. Mr. Rastogi has been frank
cnough to state before the Court that on the first information of the
crash near Loktak Lake in the afternoon of 16th August, 1991, he
went along with the police officials but when nothing was found in
and around the area of Loktak Lake, he came back without any
further aitempt to locate the wreckage. He is quite content in
fiiforming the Deputy Commissioner of Police to look for the air-
craft. I did not find in him even at the witness box any anxiety in
locating lhe crash site. As a matter of fact, according to his own
statement, he got the information about the crash sile next day
morning when all the newspapers in the ceuntry reported the
accident including ils location. Is il expected of a Civil Aviation
industry man to know of the crash site on the next morning, ty my
view, the answer cannot be in the affirmative. Safety of the people
ought to be the foremost consileration for a Civil Aviation industry
man in the country. Assuming there were some survivors, what
would have happened to them if no medical attention was made
available within shortest possible tine - one does not know. Mr.
Rastogi is the man on-the-spot, if he takes this attitude and slicks
to his duty chart, it would be deemed to be a very sad day for the
Civil Aviation industry in the country. The obligation to render
assistance under any circumstances should be a prime considera-
tion to an Acrodrome Officer. As a matter of fact, Mr. Rastogi’s
entire conduct does uot seem to be in consonance will a sense of
public safely and when the aircraft is (o land, he is quile content to
be “in his chamber and talking to the clients.” Thal is the attitude
which has been exhibited even in Court and which by no stretch
according to me is proper. Lam conscious of the fact that the
Seidor Acrodrome Officer has had some administralive work to do
but that does not, however, mean and imply thal when there were
oily Uiree fighis and all restricted by about mid afternoon, lhe
Senior Acrodrome Officer will be in his Chamber talking to his
clients at the time of the flight. There must be an anxiety in the

85


mind of the Senior Acrodrome Officer as to how things are proceed-
ingg at the Control Tower - there ought to be a scnuse of belouging: to
an Olficer and he must be sincere for the purpose for which he las
been asked to be there to cater for safety of the aircrall including
the passengers. Docs the conduct of the Senior Acrodrome Officer
show such an anxiety or sincerity - 1 am afraid the answer cannot
but be in the negative. It is true that Mr. Rastogi is a trained and
experienced Officer, but the country has not been able to obtain
the benefit of his training or his experience - a state of affairs
which cannot by any stretch be said to be very encouraging. It is
for the National Airports Authority to inculcate a sense of belong-
ing on to its Officers so that public safety in not in any way im-
paired or there is any compromise in regard thereto.

Mercly by sending an intimation to the police authorities, i
iy view, will not do - further steps are required to be taken which
Mr. Rastogi, according to me, has failed.

On the basis of available materials on record, it appears that
inuuediately on coming to know of the factum of the missing air-
cralt, the officials of the National Airports Authority, Calcutta,
telephonically informed Mr. R.K. Paul, Regional Controller of Air
Safety, Calcuita, who was later appointed as the Inspector of
Accidents in this investigation and Shri Paul, on his part, also
informed Shri Satendra Singh, Director Air Safely, in the DGCA
Headquarters at New Dellii. According to Mr. Paul, it was almost
certain that the aircraft had crashed. Subsequent crash informa-
Uon, however, was updated as and when further tuformation was
received from luphal through the National Airports Authority,
Calcutta. Finally, however, the information was received that the
crash site has been located around 1700 hours on 16.8.1991 by a
villager, which is at a distance of about 20.5 nautical miles from
the Imphal Airport. The relief aircraft was made ready by the
Indian Airlines, but the {ight did nol leave by reason of night
landing restrictions at hnphal. As a matter of fact, the Minister of
Civil Aviation Shri Madhav Rao Scindia arrived at Calcutta at night

86


itself so as to reach lnphal at the first available opportunity next
day morning. [tis lo be noled thal the Civil Aviation Minister
proceeded to huphal along with the Seerctary, Civil Aviation De-
partment; Director General of Civil Aviation; Deputy Director
General of Civil Aviation; Director Air Safety, Hqrs. DGCA at New
Delhi; Chairman Indian Airlines; Member Operations, National
Airports Authority and the other local DGCA and Indian Airlines
officials together with the relatives of the passengers on that ill-
fated flight.

I have been jiformed that immediately on arrival at tiuphal,
the siie was surveyed by the Minister -in-Charge of Civil Aviation in
a helicopter provided by the Indian Air force. The Indian Airlines
engineers and DGCA representatives had trekked to the site. It is
not out of place to mention that the hill which was a mute specta-
lor lo the accident, was above 5,500 feet in height and the passage
to the crash site was for all practical purposes out of bound Lo all
and sundry, more so by reason of the fact of the heavy rain and
slushy and steep terrain.

it appears from the report of the Inspector of Accidents that
one Shri Thongram Birjit Singh brought the Cockpit Voice Record-
er from the crash site and deposited with Bishenpur Police Station.
The Inspector of Accident’s Report also shows that one Shri Zamlet
Haokip was the first person who knew that the aircraft accident
had taken place at Thangjing Hill and one Shri Shamkhahen
Haokip, was the first person who informed the Police Station about
the airerafl accident. The report further disclosed that Shri K.H.
Netra, Supdt. of Police, Churachandpur, received information
around 1430 hours on 16,.8.1991 regarding a missing Indian Air-
lines Bocing aircraft through a Police radio with the instructions to
orgaise a search party for locating the missing aircralt. Initially
Mr. Netra proceeded to Loktak Lake but subsequently around 1700
hours came to know that the aircraft, in fact, had crashed at
Thangjing Hill range under Moirang Police Station. The Report of
Mr. Netra records that after reaching the crash sile, he found that

87


the aircraft was broken into pieces with dead bodies around It.
Though there was no fire but smoke was still emitting anid il was
clear to Chem that (here would be no survivors. Mr. Netra submit-
led that since it was pitch dark and no torches were even available
excepting, however, the improvised fire which could be iguited,
they had no other alternative but to wail till dawn as it was diffi-
cult on that hour to start the salvage work in darkness and in
heavy rain. The report of Shri Netra along with the report of Mr.
Priyokumar Singh being the Sub-Divisional Police Officer, Chura-
chandpur are annexed hereto and collectively marked with letter
TT.

I would fail in my duty as a Chairman of this Court of In-
quiry ff 1 do not mention the role and the effort of Manipur Adven-
ture and Allied Sports InsUitule, Imphal (MAASI). The leader of the
rescue team Shri N.J.K. Singh along with aboul 20 other young
boys has not only rendered services but what I hear from other
sources the rescue operation would have been extremely difficult
without their active participation in such opcration. | place on
record my deep sense of gralitude and my appreciation to the
leader Mr. N.J.K. Singh and his young friends for rendering such
invaluable services for the cause of humanity.

The services rendered by Manipur Rifles, Central Reserve
Police Force and Border Security Force also need special mention
and reference. MAASI volunteers together with Mantpur Rifles,
Central Reserve Police Force and Border Security Force personnel
have made it possible for the bodies being brought down to the
base camp with extreme difficully by linprovised stretchers which
should command praise from every quarter, since no mode of
transportation could be made available from the crash site by
reason of the terrain and the slushy condition ou the slopes of the
hill. The bodies had to be carried down personally on shoulders of
the volunteers and other para-military force personnel. I was
juformed that the path was so slushy and was having such a steep
slope that one person cannot even stand without a proper support

88


and even then MAASI volunteers and other para-imilitary force
personnel did not hesitate (o render all possible asststauce under
the circumstances so that the bodies could be made over to the

relatives as quickly as it Is practicable.

Incidentally, il is also to be noted that from the base stalion
upto the crash site, it has taken the search party about four hours
of very sleep climb - nothing was available, even a glass of drinking
water and it is the villagers of the nearby villages who came for-
ward with all their might and provided the drinking water and even
some fruits to the volunteers enroute to the crash point. The
gesture admittedly is admirable and I hereby record my sincere
appreciation and thanks to those villagers who have spared no
pains to be at different points enroute to the crash point lo provide
these facililies to the volunteers as otherwise it would have been
extremely difficult if not impossible to bring down the bodies so
quickly on to the base camp.

On the basis of the evidence on record, the first batch of
bodics arrived at the base camp on 18th early morning and by
about 19th all the bodies arrived at the base camp and subse-
quently transferred to the mortuary for the post mortem examina-
tion and immediately thereafter the bodies were made available to
their relatives for the last rites. | also put on record my apprecia-
tion to Indian Airlines for allowing the relatives of the passengers of
the ill-fated flight to proceed on to Imphal by air and to return to
their respective desUnations along with the bodies in wooden boxes
free of charge - an indced laudable gesture. Special mention
should be had for Mr. Ramdas being the Chairman of Indiau Air-
lines and Mr. Deb Burman, Deputy Director Commercial of ludian
Airlines along with some other Indian Airlines officials by reason of
their ardent effort lo give solace and pacifying the relatives imme-
diately after the crash. All the loved ones were iliere to have a last
glimpse and It is an extremely difficult situation lo manage. I have
been told that both the above named officials of Indian Airlines

have conducted themselves in such a way which cannot but be

89

termed praise-worthy. | record my appreciation and sincere thanks
fo them for their huntane conduct and behaviour tniside the

janortuary al Imphal.

In fine, considering the location of the crash site and consid-
ering the slushy terrain, I am of the opinion that the search and
rescue operation proceeded in a manner as is expected in such
circumstances and no further, betler or quicker arrangement could

have been made.

ll. WRECKAGE INFORMATION :

Details of wreckage information would appear from the
report of the Inspector of Accidents and for convenience sake, the
saine Is quoled hereinbelow :-

"This aircraft impacted on the hill at a point approxi-
matcly 200 feet from the top of Thangjing hill which ts
located 20.5 NM South-West of Iniphal Acrodrome with
a bearing of 220° from VOR. Although the aircraft had
broken to pieces, wreckage was limiled to a small area
(400M X LOOM) and could be viewed from the top of
the hill. The inclination of the slope at the point of
impact is about 60° to 70°. The major parts of the
airplane were strewn with the empennage of the air-
craft at the lower most point of the crash sile. Onc
wing was found to the left and another similar struc-
ture to the right. These were almost half-way of the
crash site (longitudinally). Just above the right hand
side wing, was one undercarriage identified as LH
undercarriage. The nose wheel was almost on the top
of the crash site. Due to massive destruction and
parts disturbed by the local inhabitants, it was not
possible to co-relate many positions during this
wreckage examination. Alse, there was post-accident
fire which destroyed parts.

However, it could be determined that the landing gear
was In UP position as found from the landing gear
operating actuator. Fore, mid and aft flaps were seen
along with right hand wing separated from the fuse-
lage. The flaps were out which corresponds to ap-
proach position. The horizontal stabilizer was cut off
about 30" from extreme outboard end and right hand
horizontal stabilizer was in one piece. Rear pressure
bulkhead was separated from the fuselage. The fin,
which separated out was clearly visible with L.A.
monogram while engine was traced on the L.H. side,
another cugine casing was lying on the L.IH. side of
crash site."

Mr. D.K. Roy, the Deputy Engineering Manager of Indian
Alrlines at Calcutta, being one of the persons who also reached the
crash site has stated thal there was practically no road and it was
the very Lough journey. Mr. Roy stated that while he was going up,
he found quite a lot of people conung down from the crash site with
sinall articles belonging to the aircraft. At the crash site, the CVR
was found out by one of the technicians of Indian Airlines being

91 .


carried by one person on his back. There was also a photographer
and the latter was asked to fake the photograph of the man carry-
dug the CVR. The matter was reported thereatter to the police and
the man was (raced out and the CVR was recovered wilhout there
being any damage and with proper seals. The FDR also was locat-
ed somewhere else around 30 kms away from the crash point in a
village and was hidden in a banana bush. This FDR would not
have been recovered but by reason of a generous taxi driver who
came and reported the factum of the removal of the FDR from the
crash site to a village and hiding it under a banana bush by a
villager. It is to be placed on record that the FDR was recovered
without also there being any further damage to the recorder ex-
cepting the impact damage. A wreckage distribution chart for
convenience sake, is also annexed hereto and marked with letter

12. GENERAL OUTLINE OF INVESTIGATION BY THE COURT
OF INQUIRY :

Government of India vide Notification No.AV.15013/5/91-
SSV dated 26th September, 1991 constituted the Court of lnquiry
under Rule 75 of the Aircratt Rules, 1937, wherein | was appointed
for the formal investigalion of the crash of the Indiai Airlines flight
being No. IC-257 (the route being Caleutla-lmphal-Dimapur) on
16th August, 1991, near Thangjing Hill at Lmphal, Manipur, to be
assisted by Mr. B.P. Baliga, a former Director of Engineering, Air
India and Wing Cdr. P. Ashoka, Executive Direclor, Hindustan
Aeronautics Limited, as Assessors. Mr. A.K. Sinha, Senior Air
Safety Officer, in the Directorate of Director General of Civil Avia-
tion, Calcutta, was appointed as the Secretary to the Court of
Inquiry. The Court was requested to submit its report by 31st
December, 1991, but subsequently, however, the {ime was extend-
ed ull 30th April, 1992.

It is to be noted that Mr. R.K. Paul, Regional Controller of Air
Safety in the Directorate of Director General of Civil Aviation,
Calcutia, was appointed as the Inspector of Accidents by the Direc-
tor General of Civil Aviation immediately after the unfortunate
crash on 16th August, 1991.

On the constilution of the Court, Mr. Paul did call on me and
apprised me of the work which has already been done by him
including examination of some witnesses. | requested Mr. Paul to
continue and complete his investigation in the matter with utmost
expedition.

On 8th October, 1991, I along with the Assessors named
above, together with the Director Gencral of Civil Aviation Mr. MLR.
Sivaraman, Deputy Director General of Civil Aviation Mr. H.S.
Khola, Director Air Safety in the Directorate of the Director General
of Civil Aviation Headquarters Mr. Satendra Singh, the Inspector of
Accident Mr. R.K. Paul and the Secretary to the Court of Inquiry
Mr. A.K. Sinha reached Imphal for the purpose of an on-the-spot

93

survey of the crash sile and obtaining necessary details in regard
to the crash of the alreraft (VT-EFL). The Indian Air Foree authort-
ics did provide a helicopter for the purpose of a survey of the
crash site, but in spite of our best efforts by hovering over the area
in question in the helicopter, the survey was not possible by reason
of the inclement weather conditions and the Thangjing Hill being
overcast with clouds.

I, however, did have detailed discusstons with the State
Police and the acrodrome officials as also the doctors who per-
formed the post mortem exanunations of the bodies of the passen-
gers and that of the crew members of the ill-fated aircraft. Next
day morning also there was an attempt to have an on-the-spot
survey bul continuance of inclement weather prevented us from
being at the crash site.

On return to Calcutta, however, I along with the officials of
the DGCA and my Assessors inspecied the engineering division al
the hangars of Indian Airlines at Calcutta and ascertained the
niode and method of doing the overnight checks. The Chief Engi-
neering Manager Mr. S. R. Chakravarty and the Deputy Engineer-
ing Manager Mr. D.K. Roy, along with other engineering personnel
of Indian Airlines assisted us whilst at the hangars. The Regionai
Director of Indian Airlines, Calcutta Region, Mr. U.P. Singh, was
also present at the discussions. There were further discussions
with the Executive Director, Calcutta, NAA Mr. S.C. Goswami and
the Director of Aerodromes, NAA Mr. H.S. Roy.

On 11th October, 1991, | proceeded to Deli for an assess-
ment of the CVR transcript and FDR read-out which lad already
been effected by Mr. Satendra Singh, Director Air Safety al DGCA
Headquarters. The two assessors were also present at the time of
such an assessment of the CVR transcript and FDR read-out. At
Dellil i met the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Mr,
Ravindra Gupta, as also the Director General of Civil Aviation and
the other top officials in the Directorate. At Delhi I had detailed

94


discussions with the then Chairman-cum-Managing Director of the
Indian Airlines Air Marshal S.S. Ramdas, the Chairman of the
National Airports Authorily Air Marshal C.K.S. Raje, (he Member
Operations National Airports Authority AVM. H.M. Shahul, the
Director of OperaUons Indian Airlines Capt. R.K. Kakkar and the
Direclor of Flight Safely Capt. P.M. Jog. I also had a meeting with
the Bocing Company’s representative in India together with the
representatives of Pratl & Whitney, the manufacturers of Bocing-
737 engines in regard to the issue of engine failure as also the
Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). The shearing of
engines was also discussed al the meeting. There was a further
meeling with the Pratt & Whitney representative at my residence at
Calcutta on 14th Oclober, 1991, wherein the issues as regards age
of the engines and the engine fatlure were discussed at length.

In order to be certain about the structural slabikily of the
aircraft on 20th October, 1991, I visited Bangalore and had dis-
cussions about the same including information on stress and
strain analysis of the aircraft components wilh Prof. R. Narasimha,
Director, Nallonal Acronautical Laboratory (NAL), along with other
officials of NAL in the presence of the Assessors. It is indeed not
out of place to record that having detailed discussions in regard to
the structural stability of the aircraft (VI'-EFL), it came to light that
question of there being a structural failure does not arise.

While the preliminary investigations were being carried out, I
directed my Secretary to cause necessary advertisement to be
published in all leading newspapers of the country so that any
person having any knowledge and who desires (o make a represcen-
tation concerning the circumstances or the cause of the accident
may do so in wriling in the form of an affidavit sworn before a
notary public or a Magistrate first class or any Metropolitan Magis -
trate and address the same to the Secretary, Court of Inquiry as
constituted by the Government Notification noted above for investi-
gation of the cause of the accident to the Indian Airlines Boeing
737 aircraft VT-EFL near Imphal. The advertisement was duly

95


published in all leading dailles of the country ineluding the local
newspapers at Manipur and Nagaland om or about 27th October,
1991,

To ascertain the flight path followed by the alrcraft which
ultimately resulted in the crash, I visited Bombay on 9th Novem-
ber, 1991 to have a simulator flight at the Air India A-310 simula-
tor, on the basis of tie FDR read-outs. Incidentally, it is to be
noted that the A-310 simulator is one of the most modern and
sophisticated simulator available preseitly throughout the globe
and the effort was to obtain the flight path on the computer in
order to avoid any misconception about the path followed by the
aircraft. [record my sincere appreciation to Air India and in par-
ticular its Director of Operations Capt. D-S. Mathur and the
Deputy Director Capt. J.R. Trilokekar and the other instructors of
Alr India who have assisted in such a simulation fight and obtatn-
ing a computer print oul of the flight path on the basis thereof.

On 13th November, 1991, I visited the Civil Aviation Training
College of National Airports Authority at AUahabad in order to
obtain a first-hand information about the Waining system of the Air
Traflic Control Officers. At ihe training institute, detailed discus-
sions were had in the presence of my Assessors with the Member
Operations AVM H.M. Shahul and other NAA officials. The entire
syllabi was made available io us as also the methods of teaching
and practical training aspects were noted.

On 16th November, 1991, I did visit the (raining institute of
ludian Airlines at Hyderabad for the purposes of ascertaining the
training course of Pilots as also to note the practical training
aspect. Whilst at Hyderabad I took the opporttualy of having a
further simulation flight on B-737 simulator in order to ascertain
the flight path of the aircraft.

In order to have the public hearings of the Court of Inquiry, I
personally requested the Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative

96

Assembly Mr. Hasim Abdul Halim to provide me the Counsel
Chamber (Syed Naushar Ali Hall) aud Mr. Halim was gracious
cnough to acconunodate me and permitted (his Court of Inquiry to
hold its sittings al the above Hall. [ hereby record my sincere
thanks to Mr. Halim for this accommodation. Needless to say that
the Court hadn't had to pay any charge therefor.

Further adverlisements were published in the newspapers
for open sittings of the Court of Inquiry on and from 30th Novein-
ber, 1991. The Court did, in fact, commenced its proceedings on
and since the above noted dale.

During the course of hearing, I felt that the flight path ol
some of the earlier flights to hmphal undertaken by Capt. Shekhar
Halder as Pilot-in-Command ought also to be examined so as to
ascertain the mode and method of flying so far as Capt. Haldar is
concerned. Ju pursuance whereof, I directed the Indian Airlines to
make available to the Court at least four carller flight data recorder
foils for the purpose of examination. The Indtan Airlines did
comply with such a direction and made over four flight data re-
corder foils identifying the flighis as that of Capt. Sekhar Halder on
Calcutia-liphal route.

Alter the foils were made over to the Court, the same were

readings on the foils and obtained necessary details therefrom. It
is to be noted that the foils were decoded by Mr. Satendra Singh,
Director Air Safety, DGCA Headquarters, and the FDR read-out for
all the four foils were made available to the Court. Subsequently |
dirceted the copies of the four FDRs to be circulated to all (he
parties so that necessary submissions may be made in regard
therelo by the concerned parties.

Upon obtaining the four FDR read-outs, | directed Mr.
Satendra Singh to go to Hyderabad along with Capt. Melita, the
then Operations Manager, Indian Airlines, Calcutta Region, to
obtain a simulation path of the above noted four flights on the

97

Bocing 737 simulator and in accordance therewith within a short
while therefrom, the four several Might paths on the route Calcutta-
lphal as plotted on a computer graph were made available to the
Court by Mr. Satendra Singh.

For further confirmation on to the flight path, | did visit
Bombay on 17th January, 1992 and had the simulator exercise
and also obtained the four flight paths of the aircraft In regard to
the above noted four FDRs.

Some confusion arose as the exact location of the crash site
during the hearing by reason of which I directed the Deputy Direc-
tor General of Civil Aviation to arrange for a further visit to Imphal
for an on-the-spot Inquiry. To facilitate the issue necessary ar-
rangements werc made to position an Emergency Locator Trans-
milter (ELT) at the crash site so that while flying on an A-320
aircraft necessary signals may be obtained in order to deterniine
the correct distance of the crash site from the VOR point. Indian
Space Research Organisation, Bangalore, was also requested to
pick up the signal through satellite and indicate the coordinates of
the source of signal. Though the ELT was placed at the crash sile,
but waforlunately due to bad weather conditions as also hoi-avail-
ability of the VOR at Imphal airport the flight to lunphal via
Guwahati could not be operated on that day. The Bangalore Space
Research Centre, however, obtained the signals and subinitted the
approximate coordinates of the crash site, but in order to confirm
the exact location, the Surveyor General of India was requested to
provide this Court with necessary coordinates which was made lo
this Court by way of a certification as slated above, suffice however
to record here that the distance between the VOR tmphal and the
top of the Thangjing hill has been certified to be 20.19 NM.

At the hearing, the issue of clearance of the hill on pilots
immediate reaction, upon the sounding of the GPWS came up for
consideration and in order to appreciate it better, | went to Hyd-
erabad on Ist March, 1992, and with the assistance of Capt.
Thargaonkar and Capt. DeCosta, I did have a simulation exercise
in regard thereto.

98

Altogether 25 Court sittings were held out of which 24 were
at Calcutta and one silting was at Imphal. The Indian Airlines, the
National Airports Authority, the ATC Guild, (he ICPA, the Air
Passengers Association, the Aircraft Maintenance Enginecrs Asso-
elation along with one Mr. Kapat being a social worker did partici-
pate at the hearing. In toll 27 witnesses were examined in detail
on various aspects including the training of pilots, co-pilots and
the ATCOs. The last of such heariug did take place on 7(h March,
1992. It is io be noted that the sitting at Imphal was necessitated
by reason of the fact that the local people would have an opportu-
nily to express their views in the matter as otherwise il would uot
lave been possible for them to do so at the Headquarters of the
Court at Calcutta. As a matter of fact. one Mr. frengbam Boyai-
singh came up before the Court and stated that from the news-
paper report he came to know thal the pilot of the ill-fated aircratt
wanied to have an emergency landing but the ATCO did not permit
Juin lo land and asked him to wait for ten or fillteen minutes. ‘This
confusion, however, had to be cleared since there was no permis-
Sion sought for by the atreraft, neither any cmergency existed and
in that view of the matter, this Court made over a copy of the CVR
transcript to him and asked him to appear before the Court after
the luncheon recess. Apparently he was satisfied that there was
no such emergency existed since he did not come back after the
recess. It is also to be noted that on his prayer that the belongings
of his father, being a victim of the crash, which were lying at the
Police Station and the Depuly Commissioner of the Police of the
area was directed to release the same willin 24 hours from the
date of the order.

Subsequently, however, at the request of the Goverment, 1
did visit Sydney in Australia and Singapore for the purpose of
undertaking a study as regards the training standards in these (wo
countries wilh a view to upgrade the training in India, if it is so
required. It is to be noted that I left the country in the evening of
10th April, 1992 by Air India Night from Caleutia and upon
completion of the study as requested, arrived at Caleutta in the
afternoon of 19th April, 1992, instead of 22nd April, 1992, as
scheduled earlier.

13. ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE TENDERED BEFORE THE
COURT OF INQUIRY:

The evidence tendered before the Court of Inquiry for the
purpose of correct appreciation may be sub-divided under the
following heads :-

i) Possibility of sabotage;

ii) Airworthiness of the aircraft;

iil) Calearance to direct outbound approach;

iv) Flight path followed by the ill-fated aircraft vis-a-vis
the operational fight plan and the ILS let down chart;

v) Role of co-pilot during the flight.

vi) Possibility of wrong indication by VOR;

vil) GPWS warning and crew response.

It will be convenient to deal with the above seriatin:

i) Possibility of Sabotage:

The Indiau Airlines Bocing-737 (VT-EFL) while on a sched-
uled flight on route Calcutta-luphal-Dimapur being flight No.IC-
257 crashed near Imphal Airport into the hill slopes of Thangjing
Hill with its nose hitting a place approximately 300 fect below the
summit of the hill. Major C.B. Lal, Controller of Explosives,
Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, Calculta Airport, visited the
crash site for an on-the-spot visual inspecUion and examination of
the wreckage on 17th and 18th Atigust, 1991 for the purpose of
ascertainment of the factum of there being any sabolage. Itis the
definite evidence of Major Lal thal he has not seen any positive
signature of explosives or explosion in the aircraft on thle wreckage
examination. Major Lal pointed out (hat if there was a bomb
planted on the aircraft and an explosion resulting Uherefrom, there
would have been definite signatures on the metal as well as in the
various wreckages of the aircraft and on the dead bodies. In his
evidence he has explained the posilive signatures as (a) the forma-
Hon of distinctive surface effects such as piling or very sinall

100

craters formed in metal surface caused by extremely high velocity
input from small particles of explosives and such craters would
have ratsed or have rolled over edges and often have explosive
residue in the bottom of the craters; (b) the surface cliecis would
have shown metal fragments produced by explosives and would
have caused deformation mechanism which are peculiar (o high
rate of strain at normal temperature together with a dislocation
movement: because the Process in an explosion is thermally acti-
vated ata very high rate of strain. Major Lal explained that in
some metals such as copper, iron and steel deformation in the
crystal of the metals takes place by twinning, that is to Say, the
parallel lines or cracks cutting across the crystal. He went on to
say (hat such Phenomenon can ouly occur if the Spectinen or the
subject has been subjected to extreme shock wave leading at veloc-
ity in the order of 8,000 metres per second.

On a pointed question from the Court as to whether the
wreckage, as it is in the mnalter under investigation, can have the
Same affectation in the eveul of an object hilting the aircraft from
ground, to wit, a missile, the answer of Major Lal, however, was in
the negative, since it will create a perforation and then as usual
the explosive blast would be there. Major Lal observed that in that
event, there are also chances of pieces of nussile overhead portion
being available at the wreckage site and as such air external object
being thrown and lutting the aircraft cannot but be ruled out and
so Js the sabotage by micaus of a bomb being planted on board the
aircraft. The report of Major Lal depicts that on exalnination of
wreckage, centre of explosion and explosion pressure profile could
nol be determined as damage to the aircrait's one Wilf, nose,
cockpit and passenger cabin was total and slinilar as in the case of
resultant impact of high speed aircraft. The Phenomenon of
fragmentation, curling/riuglet effects and spike looth fractures in
metal surface were also not observed on visual examination. The
phenomenon of cupping/dishing of metal Stuface, high velocity
penetration of fragments in interior furniture, cushion and plastic
fitments due to explosion were not observed. Major Lal reported

101

fo

that in the light of visual Inspection of the crash Site and examina-
fion of wreckage in-situ, the theory of mid-air bomb exploston and
sabotage is rejecled. For convenience sake, however, (he report of
Major Lal on the issuc of Sabotage is annexed hereto and Marked
with letter ‘J' (ihe photographs and charts though cuclosed with
the report and exhibited before the Court of Inquiry are, however,
not included in annexure ‘J to avoid (he bulk).

Ji) Airworthiness of the Aircraft -
—eeemettess of the Aircraft

As noled above under the head Alrcraift Information, this
particular aircraft VT-EFL was delivered to Indian Airlines on 3rd
December, 1977. The Certificate of Airworthiness was last re-
newed on 26th November, 1990 and was valid upto 27th Novem-
ber, 1991. The aircraft as per the available evidence ou record,
both documentary and oral, was Inaotained on the basis of ap-
proved maintenance Schedules and all mandatory modifications
and inspections sUpulated by the Directorate General of Civil Avia-
Yon have duly been carried out. Mr. DK. Roy being the Deputy
Engineering Manager, Indian Airlines, Calcutta, has Stated that
this particular alrcraft was duly checked by the Engineering
Department in all ils schedules and he was personally involved in
regard thereto. The Check ‘B’ Inspection Schedule was carried out
on the night of 15th August, 1991, ending in the morning hours of
16th August, 1991. The document pertaining to the Check *B’
schedule has duly been Signed by five different Persons in (he
Engineering Diviston of Indian Airlines. Mr. Roy has further stated
that as a matter of fact the alreraft had come ou the day before
from Delhi to Calcutta via Lucknow, Patiig and Rauchi and then if
had done the flight in the route Calcutta to Hyderabad via Bhuba-
neswar and back before the Check "B’ Schedule was carried out. It
is not out of Place to record that the Check ‘B’ schedule includes
luspection of electrical and other Navigational aids of the aircraft.
Mr. Roy has further stated that usual pre-departure check was
also carried out prior to the departure of this aircraft from Calcutta
for Imphal and Dimapur. No Snag was reported on the carller day

102

when the aircraft was in flight cither from Delhi to Calcutta as
above or from Caleulta to Hyderabad and back exceptings that the
APU (Auxilhary Power Unit) generalor was non-fine Fonts, The
APU snag, however, was allowed to continue even after the Check
*B’ inspection as by reason of the von-availability of spares at
Calcutta, (he unit could not be rectified, but the aircraft was certl-
fied to be fil lo undertake the flight by reason of the fact that APU
is one of the MEL items which permits the operator to carry for-
ward the snag upto a period of 72 hours.

While it is true aud as appears from the evidence that (here
will be no compromise with the safety of the aircraft in the event of
the APU penerator being unserviceable, bul i does not hespeak of
proper administration on the part of the operator, more so when
Calcutta is a major air base for Bocing 737 alreratts with all the
major tuspections upto Cheek-I level are being carried out at
Calcutta. I is to be noted further in this context that all checks
upto 1,500 hours of the Bocing 737 aircraft are done at Caleutta
aud beyond that the checks are always being carried out al Delhi
and as such spares ought to be made available at Calcutta as
otherwise there is likelihood of such snags being carricd forward
probably upto its last limit, namely, 72 hours which cannot by any
stretch be said to be an encouraging slate of affairs.

From the available records, il appears that this particular
aircraft VT-EFL was not involved in any ntajor incident necessitat-
ing any major structural repair.

Needless to record here however, that during the (light no
emergency was transmitted by the flight crew at any point of time
prior to the crash. The CVR recordings also show thal there was
no intra-cockpit conversation indicating any aircraft snag during
the flight. The report of the Controller of Explosives, Calcutta
Airport, indicates that ihe entire wreckage of the aircraft was locat-
ed within a small area thereby depicting that there was no inflight
structural failure as otherwise it would have resulted in a much

103


wider scalier of the wreckage. It is also pertinent to note thal the
FDR daia does not show any abrupt change in atreraft fligstit
parameters and (he data indicates Ghat i was a fully controlled
flight ll the Gime of impact.

On the basis of the above discussions, if can thus be safely
concluded that the aircraft (VT-EFL) operaling flight IC-257 (Cal-
cutta-Lmphal routc) was fully airworthy prior to ils departure from
Calculta and during the course of entire Night until the time of
impact.

While it is true that the aircraft was otherwise safe and
secure for undertaking the flight, but 1 will be failing in amiy duty if
do not record certain observations of mine in regard to the mainte-
nance facilily at (he Calcutta Airport as also in regard to the MEL
items,

The existing facility al Caleutla Airport for undertaking
maintenauce work though cannot be said to be lacking in any way
amenity-wise but discussions wilh the engineers and technicians
reveal that slightly better facility may be made available specially
during the night time. The availabilily of spares al Calcutta alr -
port, however, nced also to be augmented.

Coming back on to the MEL item in slighlly more greater
detail, iUis seen that the manufacturers of the aircraft has Itsel!
provided for carrying forward of certain snags, the list of which
appears from the manufacturers Masters Minimum Equipment
List. The Director General of Civil Avialion, however, upon cousid-
eration of the Indian situation modified the list by providing lesser
number of items in the MEL so as to conform to the Indian condi-
Uons, cousidering the total safety aspects of the flight.

Another redeeming feature came lo light during the course of

investigation to the effect that while It is true that no snag is al-
lowed to continue from the major base after the night halt, but if

104

the snag is delected one hour prior to the departure and the snag
being one of the MEL ilems, the atrerafl can be cleared with the
snag carried forward. The operator seenis to be quite content with
this sort of practice but iu my view the sooner it is dispensed with
the better for safety sake since there is likelhood or at least the
possibility cannot be rwed out that this detection at the late stage
may be a deliberate one.

Hi) Clearance to Direct Outbound Approach :

The most controversial Issue in this inquiry is in regard to
grant of permission by Air Traffic Control to go directly outbound
on ihe basis of a request from the pilot for sclling course directly
outbound for let down.

In order to apprectate and to deal with Che matter in tts
proper perspective, the approach briefing by Pilot-tn-Conimand to
the Co-pilot for convenience sake ought to be noted. The CVR
transcript for approach bricfing reads as follows :-

07:01:59 PL P2 Visual - - or otherwise we will go
overhcad 10,000 feet then on the
hold cleared to 8,000 feet and 070
this will be tear drop entry inbound
217 after that leaving VOR 217 8000
to 5000 feet check time (wo and half
minute and then in descending turn
fo 4200 and then further descend
on interception glide slope only
correction 5,000 feel then a proce-
dure turn after that further inter-
ception with glide slope desccuding
to decision height 224. Then in case
of missed approach climb straight
ahead to 4200 feet then turn left to
join VOR holding climbing 8,000
feet.

105


Before proceeding further, however, it is to be noled that as
per the flight plan and the let down cliart, the aircraft ts to come
overlicad VOR from South-Westerly direction al a heading of 070°
and after reaching overhcad VOR and upon completion of the
holding pattern there ilself should follow a radial of 217° for
outbound leg.

Coming back to the CVR transcription as recorded above
under the head ‘Approach Briefing’ being an intra-cockpit conver -
sation between the Pilot-in-command and the Co-pilot, it appears
that while descending to flight level 135 and as a matter of fact
much before even the aircraft was abeam Khumbigram, the
Pilot-in-Cotmiand decided to make a tear drop citry aller coming
overhead VOR at 10,000 fect and the permission sought and the
subsequent approval grauled by the ATCO shall have to be consid-
ered on this background that at ue point of Gime the pilot wanted
to complete the holding pattern overhead VOR but some such
turning which would permit him to avail of radial 217° from 070”,
Four transiissions as appear from the CVR transcript between
07:09:45 to 07:09:59 (UTC) ought to be noted at this juncture
being the basic transmissions in regard to the issue in question.
The transmissions read as follows:-

07.09.45 = 1C-257 Iinphal Now, we are one two miles
inbound at ten thousand
Loo9.

07.09.53 — Tuphal 1C-257 O.K. maintain report overhead
VOR.

07.09.55 IC-257 Imphal Roger Overhead, can we sel
course directly outbound for
let down.

07.09.59 Imphal IC-257 Roger, you are cleared.

106


The transmissions above, depict that when the aircraft
reported 12 nautical miles away, the tower told the aircraft to
mInaduitak and report overhead VOR. There cannot be any niaiuner
of doubt that the controller at the tower required the aircraft to
reporl as and when aircraft reaches overhead VOR. The next
transmission is recorded at 07:09:55 1t.e. barely two seconds after
the tower's requirement to report overhead VOR, ({hrough which
the Pilot-in-Conumand sought permission to set course directly
oulbound for let down and the tower shortly thereafter granted
such a permission by transmitting "Roger, you are cleared",

Two very senior and experienced pilots of the operator were
examined and both of them inno uncertain terms slated that there
cannot possibly be any scope for avoiding overhead VOR while
landing at Imphal Airport. As a matter of fact, the intra-cockpit
conversation corroborates such statements.

Capt. Mehta in answer to Question No.215 has stated that
the pilol has to go overhead aud by direct outbound what he meant
was, he shall not join the holding pattern and turn right by 30° so
that he can pick up 217° and proceed. Further in auswer to Ques-
tion No.216 Capt. Mehta categorically staled that when people ask
for direct outbound, it is just on conung overhead and proceeding
outbound directly but after coming overhead VOR. Incidentally it
is to be noted that on a poinied question from the Court, Capt.
Mehta stated that wtih 8 octa cloud he would never ask for a
pernussion for a direct outbound without Joining the holding pat-
tern of overhead VOR.

Capt. Rahut, another very expericuced pilot of the operator
also in no uncertalu terms stated that even if one wants to come
direct outbound, there is no escape but to come overhead VOR and
then go on radial 217 and direct outbound does not mean that he
will not go overhead VOR (vide Q. 130 to 134).

107


On a plain reading of the statements, il is, therefore, clear
and apparent Ghat the permission to set course directly outbound
obviously mean and tiply, when overlicad and not lo set coarse
directly outbound for ict down from that point itself. Both Capt.
Mehta and Capt. Rahut have in no uncertain ferms stated that
pilot shall have to come overhead VOR in any event. The ATCO
also if under that belief, cannot thus be said to be wrong more so
by reason of the fact that a distance of 12 miles cannot be covered
in just two seconds. It is an inconceivable idea that a pilot would
comience a let down without getting a ground fix namely, over-
head VOR. Further, it 1s to be noted that the pilot, in fact, at
07:11:26 UTC transmitted on an enquiry from the Tower about the
position of the atrerafl as "We are approaching overhead". Tis tn
evidence thal selling course directly outbotnd can be affected by
making a loop or a tear drop entry and it is as per the choice of the
Pilot-in-Command. The Senior Acrodrome Officer Mr. Rastogi has
staled such a tear drop entry is permissible and as a matter of fact
the pilot among themselves have decided to make a tear drop entry
overhead VOR. Incidentally it is to be noted that al the approach
briefing the pilot has in no uncertalu terms stated that visual or
otherwise he will come overhead VOR at 10,000 [cet and obtain
radial 217 after a tear drop entry.

Can it thus be stated that the transmission from the Tower
to the pilot in approval of the request of the pilot to go direct
outbound has really mislead the pilo€ - tn mry view the auswer
cannot but be in the negative. The pilot is responsible for safe
landing at the airport - he has to decide what approach he will
make; Une AFCO does not have any say in the matter, though
however, some amount of extra carc on the part of the ATCO would
undoubtedly have been betler. It is the standard procedure that
the pilot shall have to report overhead VOR, as a matter of fact the
ATCO did ask the pilot to report when overhead VOR and the pilot
in turn has acknowledged it by using the expression ‘Roger’.
Subsequent transmission approaching overhead from the pilot and
“understand proceeding on a radial 217" ought also to be consid-

108


ered. Radial 217 ts ihe correct flight path which a pilot should
follow - reminding the pilot of lis radial even if the pilot is proceed-
Ing direct outbound - fu my view ought to have given the pilot
sufficient indication so far as safety is concerned from the ATCO's
point of view. It is for the pilot to manoeuvre the aircraft and
obtain (he radial 217 and not for the ATCO to bring him on to
radial 217 from overhead VOR - aftcrall the pilot is incharge of the
aircraft and not the ATCO. Considering the matter from the other
point of view, even one cannot but come lo an inescapable conclu-
sion that the pilot understood by such transmission from the
Tower that he shall have to come overhead VOR as otherwise he
would not have transmitted at a subsequent point of time that he
is approaching overhead VOR. This factum of subsequent trans-
mission negates the theory of the pilot being-mislead by the grant
of permission for direct outbound. It is needless to say that itis a
pilot who has sought permission to go direct outbound and not the
ATCO on his own required the aircraft to go direct outbound. The
ATCO only approved the approach of the pilot which under the
normal circumstances the ATCO permits. Assuming, the pilot
asks for a visual approach since the runway is in sight - would the
ATCO negative such an approach - in the normal circumstances
the answer is in the negative - the reason being the pilot ought to
know what approach to make for safe landing of the aircraft and
this is a standard procedure to grant permission to a visual ap-
proach for landing when such a permission is sought for. The
transmission under consideration is also one such approval on the
piloUs secking such a permission - moreso, by reason of the fact
that the approach Js a pilot-orlented approach and not a radar-
vectored approach whereii the ATCO is the persou responsible for

sale vectoring of the aircraft upto final approach for landing.

Turning now on to the other aspect of the matter as to
whether this particular call-out can be termed to be a justifiable
call-out - Capt. Mehta in no uncertain terms stated il to be an
absolutely wrong call-out. Let us now try to analyse the siluation
in a slightly more greater detail. The flight plan available to the

109


pilot depicts that he should approach overhead VOR with 070°
heading which mean and fmply that the afrerafl should be ap
proaching the VOR trom the South-West direction. Havings the
heading in mind, it would be a near linpossibility to obtain out-
bound radial 217 before outer marker unless, however, the pilot
comes overhead VOR and follows a tear drop turn or joins the VOR
hold for proceeding outbound since the angle of turn would other-
wise be extremely difficult to manoeuvre.

On the basis of the above, it can therefore be safely conclud-
ed that this particular call-out secking permission to go direct
outbound cannot be termed to be a proper call-out but a wrong
call-out as Capt, Mehta deseribed it. As a matter of fact, the pilot
wanted to cut short his timings, which has unfortunately placed
him much beyond the safety zone. The details of the pilot's action,

however, would be dealt with hereinbelow.

iv) Flight Path followed by the ill-fated aircraft vis-a-vis the
Flight Plan and ILS Let Down Chart :

The operator for all its routes evolved various operational
fight plans detailing out the headings at different points of time for
the entire route and Imphal is no exceplion. The flight plan for
Calcutta-lmphal sector categorically states the MORA - 10,000
feet. In ordinary common English parlance MORA - 10,000 feet
mean and imply safe altitude upto 10,000 feet. The clevation of
the airport has also been given at 2,536 feet. The details of Hight
plan for Calculta-Imphal sector would appear from page 5 of this
report; Chapter 2 "The Unfortunate Flught". The flight plan depicts
a total flight Ume from Calcutta to overhead VOR Imphal to be 52
nunutes and a further cight minutes (ime has been added to facill-
tate landing at the airport on ILS let down chart from overhead
VOR. Considering the {ght plan as above, the entire flight timings
from Calcutta to Imphal is to the extent of GO minutes. The flight
plan takes care upto overhead VOR Imphal and the let down chart
thereafter guides the pilot to land Saiely un the airport upon follow-


ing the standard ILS procedure as per the let down chart and thal
precisely is the reason why the let down chart conimenees from
overhead VOR at lmphal Airport. There is definite evidence that in
the event the pilot follows the flight plan and the let down chart,
question of there being any hazard or there betng any compromise
with safety would not arise.

The FDR data as available from the FDR read-out, indicates
that the Pilot-in-Command of the ill-fated aircraft IC-257, in fact,
followed the flight plan in its entirely upto Comilla and there
exists no deviation whatsoever froin the flight plan. The devia-
ons, however, started only after the aircraft crossed over Comil-
la. FDR data records that instead of 007 heading, the aircraft
followed 053, completely by-passing overhead Agartala. The CVR
transcript, however, records a transmission at 06:51:44 UTC as
approaching overhead Alpha Alpha Tango, bul as noted above, the
FDR data tell a different story. The aircraft was nowhere near
Alpha Alpha Tango - why this call-out then - obviously to give an
finpression thal the light plan is being obcyed in its enlirely and
there is no departure therefrom. If the pilot does not give such a
call-out, the same obviously would be noted and he might be put
to books which no pilot desires. Capt. Mchta describes it as a total
indiscipline of the pilot and so does Capt. M.V.V, Rao. It is neither
fair nor reasonable on the part of the pilot of an aircraft to give a
wrong call-out. This is not the end of the Slory but just the begin-
ning. Question obviously crops up as to how a pilot having fol-
lowed the chart in totality upto a certain polnt has deviated there-
afler - the answer is not very far to seek: From Calcutta to Conmnil-
la there is every likelihood of the fight path being monitored by the
Radar Controller both at Calcutta and at Dhaka bul beyond that
question of there being any screcning of the flight path would not
arise since there is no radar control at Agartala or at Khumbigram
or at Imphal. The pilot, therefore, innovates his own procedure
and a new flight plan cutting corners here and there. | hereby
record my concurrence with the observations of Capt. Mehta that
there is total Indiscipline - why on earth a Pilot would report

lil

overhead Agartala whien, in fact, he is nowhere tear VOR Agartala
- a grossest possible indiscipline. The FDR data shows that in-
slead of having a heading of 007 the pllot-in-conunand in faet
proceedcd toa heading 053 and continued to do so for a period of
about 12 minutes, when in fact, he was Supposcd to fly with a
heading of 007 for a period of four minutes and thereafter with a
heading of 070 till such time he comes overhead hnphal. It is to be
noted that after flying about 12 nunutles, the pilot changed his
heading to around 81° and continue to fly on the saine heading for
a period of about nine minutes and subsequently changed his
heading close to 70°. But why this departure from the flight plan -
cutling corners with an aircraft is not only unsafe but connotes a
lotal lack of professional e(hies for an airman. ‘wo experienced
pilots and the senior trainer of the operator have deprecated such
an attiude of the pilot and ascribed it to be an act of indiscipline,
Culling corners is not the only Jndiscipline noted in {he pilot. As
noted above, wrong call-outs is another redeeming feature of this
particular pilot operating the ill-fated flight. ATCO's enquiry as to
the altitude has also been Une victim of such an indiscipline. The
FDR/CVR co-relation note as above, dealt with this aspect of the
matter in detail, suffice it however to record that this attitude of
transmitting wrong altitudes to the ATCO may Cven result to a
much worst catastrophe had this been happening in a major inter-
national airport where air traffic density is more.

Incidentally Wis to be noled Chat tight Plan ought to be
observed in its observance rather (han in its departure (herefrom,
Pam constrained, however, to record that there was an eltort on
the part of the operator to give an liupression to the Court that one
can deviate from the flight plan and no exception can be taken in
regard thereto. Though, however, subsequently on pointed ques-
uions from the Court, the evidence tend to show that it is a ques-
tion of ‘must’ as regards the observance of the flight plan and it
can only be varied or be deviated from Upon special permission
from the Air Traffic Controller and that also is more or less re-
Stricled to unusual Situations and Ju the event of visual landing -

which is understandable. A pilot expericncing heavy turbulence
and a cb cloud, then with the permission of the Air Traffic Control-
ler, he might deviate his course bul come back to the required
track afler avoiding the above eventualities - these are not tn the
nornial expectations but under unusual circumstances and
nobody can take any exception therefor, but in the normal circun-
stances it is now an admitted State of facts that the pilot should
adhere to the fight plan in its obedience.

The following tabulation indicating the action of the Pilot-in-
Command vis-a-vis the FDR and CVR data will corroborate the
above observations :

On the basis of the above noted tabulation, three main
deviations with respect to Might plan ceme to light and the same

are being voted hereinbelow for convenience sake :-

As mentioned earler the total fight time from Calcutta to
overhead Imphal is 52 minules as per the opcraional [light plan.
The ill-fated aircraft took-off from Calcutla at 06:24 UTC and
hence was estimated to come overhead Lnphal VOR al 0716 UTC.
After the aircraft came in contact with Imphal, it reported at
06:54:22 hours UTC that it was maintaining flight level 290 and
was estimating overhead Imphal at 07:16. After reaching over-
head Comilla, the aircraft instead of going overhead Agartala,
took almost a direct route to Imphal and ilappears that as a result
of Uus short-cut, the flight crew reported to Imphal ATC at
07:04:48 that its revised estimated time of arrival overhead fphal
was 07:12 hours UTC indicating thereby thal it would reach
Imphal four minutes ahead of the earlier esthuated time of arrival.

In accordance with the flight plan, the aircraft is expected to
conumence descent about 45 minutes after take off from Calcutta
which in the present case would be 07:09 hours UTC. From the
co-relation of CVR and FDR data, it is observed that the aircraft
had actually commenced descent at 06:59 hours UTC i.e. 10
minutes prior to the expected time of commencement of descent.
Even if the revised ETA ts considered, the descent should have
commenced around 0705 hours UTC. No valid reason could be
given under the prevailing circumstances as to why the command-
er commenced descent so carly - it only reflects disregard to the
laid down operating procedures by the fight crew. Ho may be
mentioned thal in such situation when the crew commences
descent much prior to the time indicated in the flight plan, the
estiinated time for the flight would vary on account of change of
true air speed and the commander would not be in a position to
estimate his correct lime of arrival at the destinalion. It is likely
that this may have been a factor that the crew were not knowing
exactly their position while approaching Imphal and gave incorrect

position reports. Since on account of early commencement of
descent, true air speed during descent would be lower (han the
true air speed taken into account for estimating Uight time given in
the flight plan, it is Hkely that when the crew estimated that they
would be approaching overhead VOR, they were actually much
away from the VOR which may have been a factor for carly
commencement of right turn for ILS let down. It is, therefore,
needless to emphasise that such deviations from the flight plan
could cause serious problems during the flight. Incidentally, it is
to be noted that Capt. Bagchi representing the Air Passengers
Association also expressed more or less similar view in his argu-
ments. Capt. Bagchi submitted "The flight as per Operalional
Flight Plan should have coumuenced descent from FLL. 290 al O709
or 0705 - revised; which is 1 mt. after abeam Ku. The descent
permission was given at 06:58:51 approx. 6 mits. earlier, thereby
losing TAS and this actually delayed arrival over Iniphal, which
was probably not considered. This miscalculation made the flight
lo turn right for outbound earlier". It is, however, clarified that
descent clearance may be given by the ATCO at an earlicr point of
time but actual cominencement of the descent is dependent upon
the pilot and the ATCO has no say {11 regard thereto. In any event
in the matter under consideration the descent clearance was given
to the aircraft by the ATCO at the request of the flight crew (NOTE
- Instead of Silchar it should be read as Imphal in the CVR tran-
script at 06:58:34).

Another deviation which was observed from the Cockpit
Voice Recorder transcript was that at 07:08:44 hours UTC, the
PHlot-in-Conmand had iuformed the Co-pilot that they were 25
iniles from Imphal at that time, which was perhaps on the basis of
some ground features. At 07:09:45 hours UTC 1.e. about one
minute and one sccond thereafter, the crew reported to ATC
Imphal that they were 12 miles inbound. The above information
tend to indicate as if the aireralt had covered a distance of 13 tiles
in about one minute which is an impossibility. The position report
at 07:09:45 was perhaps given on the basis of revised ETA of 07:12

11?


which got effected on account of early commencement of descent
and which does not seem to have been taken tito account by the

flight crew.

The above deviations in the actual flight path followed by the
aircraft from the latd down operational Night plan reflect scant
respect [or laid down operating procedures by the flight crew and
evidently lead to unsafe situations during flight. It also shows that
the crew did not know exact position of the aircraft during ap-
proach to Imphal primarily on account of deviations from the flight
plan. This is evident from the fact that at 07:11:29 the flight crew
reported that they were approaching overhead Imphal VOR where-
as they were actually at that tne about 15 nautical miles away
from the VOR. Based on their estimated lime of arrival of 07:12,
which was very much at variance with actual position, the (light
crew commicuced right Curn for direct outbound al 07:11:42 when,
in fact, they were still about 14 nautical miles away from the VOR.
At 07:12:13 hours UTC the flight crew reported that they were on
outbound leg for let down and were descending to 5,000 feet. At
that time, ihe aircraft was sUll about 10 nautical miles away from
the VOR. From the above it is abundantly clear that the crew had
no precise idea about their position and coupled with the fact that
they did nol report overhead VOR, they weut far away from the
normal ILS path during the let down.

The actual path followed by the aircraft during ils approach
to Imphal vis-a-vis the ILS let down path may be seen in Annexure
‘K.

In accordance with the ILS let down chart of lmphal Airport,
the aircraft is required to descend from 10,000 {cet to 8.000 feet in
the holding area and then proceed outbound on radial 217 fora
duration of two and half minutes from overhead VOR. The air-
cralt’s speed during the outbound leg is restricted to a maxinium
of 170 knots. In the process of going outbound when the aircraft
flics over middle marker and outer marker, it gets audio and visual


signals in the cockpit. During the outbound leg the aircraft
should descend from 8,000 feet to 5,000 feet. As mendoned carer
the aircraft did not report overhead VOR and, in fact, commenced
right turn when it was about 14 nautical miles away from the VOR
and at an allitude of 10,000 feet. While executing turn, the air-
craft started descent. On completion of the right turn at about
07:13:06 UTC, the aircraft flew in a direction of 196 to 210° for
about t nunute 35 seconds i.e. upto 07:14:41 UTC and during this
period the aircraft descended to an altitude of about 6,880 [eet,
Thereafter, the aircraft turned left in the form of procedure turn.

From the above it is seen that the outbound leg was totally
al variance from the normal outbound leg of an ILS procedure.
The aircraft was nowhere on radial of 217, tt never came overhead
middle marker or outer marker which is apparent from: the ground
path shown in Annexure ‘K’ vis-a-vis the ILS path. This lact is also
borne out from the CVR transcript which shows that there was no
audio signal of middle marker or outer marker recorded on the
tape during the oulbound Jeg. The ill-fated aircraft went on the
outbound leg for about one minute and thirty-five seconds as
against two and a half minutes normally required. The aircralt
speed during the outbound leg was between 175 to 180 knots,
which was higher than the maximum permissible specd of 170
knots. During the outbound leg the aircraft descended to an alti-
tude of 6,880 feet whicreas as per the ILS lel down chart it should
descend to an allitude of 5,000 feet prior to contumencement of
procedure turn.

From the CVR tape transcript it is noled that at 07:14:38
UTC there is an intra-cockpit conversation "Iwo minutes up"
indicating as if the crew were Uming the outbound leg and at that
juncture it had flown for two minutes on the outbound leg though
in fact it had flown only one minute and 35 seconds as noted
above. Admittedly the aircraft did uot come overacad VOR from
which the time calculation would have to be made as per the let
down chart for a period of two and a half minutes. There is no


evidence on record neither any onc of the partics have tried to give
any explanation as to Che fix from which the time ealeulation as
appears [from the CVR transcript was effected. Obviously, the
pilots were proceeding on the basis of some fix aud upon the expiry
of the (wo minutes have recorded the same as noted above. Capt.
Melita has stated that a pilot in the event of malfunctioning of the
VOR instrument would always check through other cockpit panel
instruments and as such the possibility of wrong VOR instrument
indication having misled the pilot does not arise. The only pre-
sumption is that the pilots well knew that they are not following
the or adhering to the route chart and in that event probably with
some ground fix they have started calculating the time. It is,
however, to be noted here thal the let down chart in fact, provides
for a fight of two and a half nunutes on the outbound leg but on
the basis of the FDR read-out there is no Inanner of doubt that the
pilots were taking a turn fmumedately after the iuftra-cockpit con-
versation - two minutes up. This curtailinent of time corroborates
the presumption that the pilol well knew that they are not follow-
ing the procedure in terms of the ILS let down chart and as such
there is no manner of doubt that turning short of VOR on to the
right hand side is a deliberate act on the part of the pilot and not
by reason of any misleading information as otherwise they would
not have even curtailed the two and a half minutes leg to one
minute thirly five seconds ouly and they obviously came to thie
conclusion that this curtailment of nearly a minute leg on the out-
bound would bring him exactly on the same position where he is
supposed to take the procedure turn in terms of the let down
procedure and be able to capture the localiser and glide slope and
other ground aids therealler for landing. This particular allempt,
however, on the part of the pilot cannot said to be justified at all
since according to Capt. Mehta ifa pilot goes directly outbound
without reporting overhead VOR, he cannot maintain the correct
reference of time from VOR.

It may also be mentioned that at 07: 14:39 ATCO had asked
the aircraft to intimate its allitude at that time, to which the air -

120


craft first reported 5,000, 5,900 feet and then on a subsequent
query from the ATCO confirmed 5,000 feet. This was evidently not
the correct altitude of the aircraft at that (ime bul the crew per-
haps reported this allitude as they were expected to be at 5,000
allilude at the end of the outbound leg.

A question arises why the flight crew deviated so much from
the laid down ILS let down procedure. The oily possible explana-
tion could be that since the aircraft did not come overhead VOR, it
had no reference with which it could measure the time of outbound
leg, fly on the outbound radial of 217 and gctting the outer marker
and middle marker signals. Since he did not lose the required
2,000 feel over VOR and did not fly for (wo and a half minutes on
the oulbound leg, he was unable to descend to an altitude of 5,000
feel at the end of the outbound Ieg.

Itis also relevant to note that the ATCO had asked the air-
craft at 07:11:37 UTC and also at 07:12:19 UTC to give a call while
commencing procedure turn. When the ATCO again asked the
aircraft at 07:14:48 to give a call conumencing procedure turn, it
inunediately reported that it was in the procedure turn. The FDR
dala shows that they had just commenced the procedure turn at
that time though at a wrong position.

While carrying out ILS let down the aircraft is expected to go
fo a maximiun distance of about 13 nautical miles front VOR. The
Metcorological Department of India has futormied that oi the day of
the accident, the upper wind at 10,000 Icet allitude at Imphal was
aboul 10 kuots in a direction from 120° which is almost a cross
wind and would not alter the aircraft position with respect to VOR
during the outbound leg or in the procedure turn. It is, however,
to be noted here that the aircraft when it commenced its procedure
turn, was at a distance of about 17 nautical miles from VOR and
during the course of the procedure turn it went to a distance of
about 20.5 nautical miles from VOR where it lunpacted with the
hill. Obviously the aircraft was ala position where it should not


have been if the laid down ILS procedure was followed. The main
reasou as to why the aircraft went out so much away trom VOR, Is
that it did not go overhead VOR and commenced right (arn for
direct outbound nearly 14 miles away from the VOR and thereafter
it could not adhere to the ILS procedure in any manner. As the
aircraft was execuling procedure turn much away from ils normal
position, the normal terrains clearance was not available in thal
arca resulting in direct impact with the hill. The weather prevail-
ing al that Ume in that region was cloudy and it is most likely that
the crew could not have seen the hill ahead prior to impact as
- there ts no intra-cockpit conversalion indicating any auxicly or
emergency during the last phase of the flight. The GPWS warning
came ‘ON’ about six seconds prior to the fmipact when the alreralt
caie over the hilly terrain and one of the conditions for triggering
GPWS warning, nanicly, excessive terrain closer rate was met. The
CVR transcript and Uae FDR data do nol indicate Wat the flight
crew reacted immediaicly to the GPWS warning (hough however,
there was a gain of about 40 feet in the aircraft allitude in (he final
few seconds indicating that perhaps the crew had initiated go
around aclion. The terrain avoidance study carried out at Boeing
facilities and the simulator exercises carried out at CTE Hydera-
bad, however, showed that even if the crew had reacted immediate-
ly to the GPWS warning it was not possible for the aircraft to clear
the hill ahead. It is however to be noted that the GPWS is not
designed to provide a timely warning while approaching a steep
hill.

At Imphal whilst the ope Court hearing was taking place,
one Mr. Irengbam Boyaisingh being the sen of one lrengbam
Tomboksingh, a passenger who unfortunately died in the crash
has stated before the Court that the Tower Control has not given
any pernussion to land to the ill-fated aircraft in spite of the fact
that the aircraft wanted such a permission for emergency landing
and as a matter of fact the Tower asked the ill-fated aircraft to wail
for 10 or 15 minutes. This bit of information Mr. Trengbam Boyai-
singh has obtained from the local newspapers and articles and as

122


such a doubt has crept in as to whether, in fact, there was any
delayed clearance of the atreratt by the Control Tower at fraiphal
which has as a matter of fact extended the outbound leg while
carrying out ILS approach. Froim the CVR transcript it is very clear
that at no stage the Air Traffic Controller had asked the aircraft to
delay landing nor the commander had sought permission from ATC
for landing or any emergency landing. Therefore, the question of
ATC delaying the permission to land does nol arise neither there
was any extension of the outbound leg of the aircraft by reason of
delayed permission.

Iu the premises it can thus safely be concluded that the Pilot
has not only deviated from the Hight plan but also nol followed the
ILS let down chart. In order, however, to ascertain as to whether,
in fact, this Is a singular instance or a regular feature with this
parlcular pilot, this Court directed the Indian Airlines to provide
the FDR spools of four earlier flights undertaken by Capt. Halder
as Ue Pilot-in-Command for Calcutta/Imphal route. In pursuance
of the above direction, the Indian Airlines did, in fact, provide the
Court with the spools and on an examination of the saine it ap-
pears that the pilot has, in fact, more or less followed the self-same
track as has becn followed in the instant Might wader invesUgation.
It was suggested by both the Indian Airlines as also by the ICPA
that on all four occasions the approach was VFR and not a IFR one
and as such question of following the same route in a weather
condition as of 16th August, 1991, does not arise. lan, however,
unable to accept such a contention since there is no evidence on
record that thee concerned pilot had sought permission for a VFR
approach. ‘The four flight paths indicate more or less the identical
Siluation viz. avoiding overhead Agartala and taking more or less a
direct route to Imphal with more or less again the same right turn
and then Jand without coming overhead VOR. It is in evidence by
two very experienced pilots as noted above that whether the flight
is VFR or IFR, the pilot shall have to come overhead VOR before
approaching the runway to land and as a matter of fact the CVR
transcript of the ill-fated flight also record at 07:01:59 "Visual or

123


otherwise we will go overhead 10,000 feet then on te hold clear to
8,000 {cet and 070 this will be tear drop entry inbound 217 after
that leaving VOR 217 ....". In none of these four cases as also in
the instant flight under investigation, the pilot, in fact, has goue
overhead VOR lphal. Capt. Mehta considering the four FDRs
and flight data in qucsUion of the i-fated aircraft on 16Uh August,
1991, has categorically stated that Capt. Halder had been deviat-
ing from the laid down procedure and his pattern is almost the
same and as a matter of fact he has not carried out the procedure
of getting into Imphal. Capt. Mehta further stated that as a pilot
they are supposed to follow the pattern which is laid down and for
which the pilots are briefed and the route charts are also wilh
them but unfortunately there is no system of knowing the roule
followed by a particular pilot unless there is a report and without
an FDR serutiny itis not possible to know or ascerlaln as lo the
(light path followed by the pilot. {Cis fo be noted also in this
context that during the tenure of Capt. Mehta as the Operations
Manager, no report has come to him to the effect thal the pilot has
not followed the route or there is any abnormality in the arrival
procedure or exit procedure.

While it is ruc that both Capt. Mehta and Capt. Raliut in no
uncertain terms have stated that the pilot shall have to come
overhead VOR for lmphal airport bul | am inclined to accept the
view of iny assessor Shri P. Ashoka that direct visual approach can
be permitted in Uhe event of there being favourable weather condi-
Uon and the ruuway and the approach path can be sighted with
ease provided however, the pilot obtains prior clearance from ATC
by reporling runway in sight.

v) Role of Co-pilot during the flight :

With the advancement of aviation technology and introduc-
tion of fly-by-wire control system, the role of Co-pilols has become
increasingly important in the present age. Co-pilot is not sup-
posed to be a mere passive and mute spectator in the cockpit bul
has a definile role to play in the matter of sale Hying of the atrcralt.

‘

124


The training progranune of the operator (Indian Airlines) also
recopnises such fmporlance and by reason wheretor co pilots are
(rained in the same quanner as (he PHot-dn-Comunand. Capt, M.V.V
Rao being the Operations Manager, Training, at CTE, Hyderabad,
in no uncertain terins stated that the co-pilot should be able to
meet all emergencies - the difference however being between the
Pilot and the Co-pilot is that while the former will be more profl-
cient the latter by reason of his lesser experience, may not be that
proficient.

Capl. M.V.V. Rao has also staled that it is one of the primary
duties of the Co-pilot to give corrective advice lo his Pilol-in-
Comman@ and in the event of lis failure to give such corrective
advice, hus efliciency cannot bul be doubled. Capt, Rao has pone
on furthd} to state that if the PHlot-in-Command makes a mistake,
it should Inot go unnoUced by lds Co-pilot and as a tmatter of Lact
both the Pilot and co-pilot should work as a tcam so that there is
no safety ‘hazard. It ts the definite evidence of Capt. Rao that iu
the eventlof deviations by the Captain, the co-pilot should caution
him and failure to administer such caution can be termed to be an
act of indiscipline and if it comes to light, steps would be taken
against Ue concerned Co-pilot. It is also the duty of the Co-pilot to
inform the management in the event of his experiencing any devia-
tions on the part of the Pilot-in-Comumand and as a matter of fact
there are some such instances, since Co-pilot is always aware of
the actions of the Pilot-in-Command during the course of the flight.

Incidentally i is to be noted that in the instant investigation,
a perusal of Cockpit Voice Recorder transmission docs not show
any word of caution or any correction to the deviations ol the Pilot-
in-Conunand by the Co-pilot. As a imatticr of fact, the Co-pilot was
as much’a party to the deviations as the Pilot-in-Comimand -
admittedly the flight crew were working as a team and both of
them were, therefore, deviating from the normal procedure as
depicted in the operational flight plan as also the ILS let down
chart. Equal indiscipline and lack of professionalisin, therefore,
can be ascribed so far as the Co-pilot is also concerned.

ra
N
ws

It is not out of place to record that the Operations Manual of
Indian Alrlines provide that the Co-pilot should monttor tle ina.
strument approach and il is especially tmportant Lhat thie Co-pilot
will automatically inform the Pilot-in-Command of any abnorimal
devialions from the approach procedure, altitude, rate of descent,
speed and timings. As a matter of fact, the Operations Manual
provides that Co-pilot during the approach acts as a safety pilot
and ought not to hesitate to inform the Pilot-in-Conunaud of any
abnormality or procedural discrepancy.

Considering the flight in question (iC-257), the deviations
right after Comilla continued till upto the crash point - not re-
porting overhead VOR Agartala and following an unspecified route
from overhead Comilla, starUng of the descent too early coutrary
to the operational flight plan; not reporting overhead VOR huophatl:
turning right much shorl of VOR al liphal; wrong altitude call-
outs at different locations, have all been accepted by the Co-pilot
without any caution or even an advice. This indicates that the Co-
pilot did not perform his duty as was expected of him. in terms of
the Operations Manual of Indian Airlines.

vi) Possibility of wrong Indication by VOR

During the course of investigation of this accident and al the
open hearings the operator raised doubt in regard Lo the mial-
functioning of the VOR being one of the navigational ald at (he
Imphal Airport. It was submitted that the Pilot-in-Comnimand has
iniliated a right (urn before coming overhead VOR, may be by
reason of a false bidication of the VOR. Capt. Mehta, however, tnt
no uncertain terms has negatived that suggestion. In this context,
particular reference may be had to queslion No. 194 and its answer
given by Capt. Mehta. The question as above together with the
answer is set out hereinbelow :-

"Q.194 : So, if you get a false indication on your VOR that can
easily be checked with the help of olher available

instrument on the cockpit itself? / Yes, cockpit has no
problem: to differentiate false signs".

Capt. Mechta clarified that mal-functionuing of VOR can easily
be checked in reference to other front pancl instruments. He
stated that it is a standard procedure that as soon as thie flag
comes in view on the instrument, the pilots check it with other
instruments. He stated thal question of being misguided by
reason of false VOR indication does not and cannot arise. Fur-
thermore, in the normal course of events, in the event of any dilfi-
culty being experienced by the pilot by reason of mal-functioning of
anyone of the cockpit instruments including VOR, there would
have been some discussions amongst the pilots and also a subse-
quent transmission in regard thereto to the Air Traffte controller.
On a perusal of the CVR transcrip{, no such inconvenience has
been discussed or transmilted to the ATCO. In fine, therefore. il
can safely be concluded that question of there being any mal-fune-
tioning of any panel instruments which could have mislead the
Pilot-in-Command does not and cannot arise.

Incidentally il is to be noted that on the fateful day two other
flights of Indian Airlines, nanicly, IC-890 from Delhi to Imphal was
operated by an Airbus A-320 aircraft and IC-255 from Calcutta to
Imphal operated by a Bocing 737 aircralt did, in fact, use all the
ground aids without any inconvenience whatsoever. The Com-
mander of 1C-255 (Capt. K. Patel) in his statement dated 220d
August, 1991, stated that all the navigational aids at lmiphal were
serviceable and were working normally. Capt. L.P. Mishra, who
opcrated the {light [C-890 has also conlirmed such a state of at-
fairs in regard to the navigational aids at lmphat Airport.

It is to be further noted that the VOR was calibrated by the
National Airports Authority aircraft by carrying out flight tests on
4th June, 1991 and its operational status was declared unrestrict-
ed. Immediately after the accident, the Director Gencral of Civil
Aviation ordered special flight check of (he VOR and other ground


aids, in pursuance whereof the ground aids at Imphal were cali-
brated on 18th August, LOOT, with a DGCA representillve for the
purpose of ascertaining as lo whether the factlides at Iniphal were
in normal working condition. The flight test ensured that all
paranicters of VOR were within the specified limits. In this con-
text, reference may be made to Annexure 'G' to this report wherein
it has been stated - “All parameters have been found to be within
defined limits. VOR let down procedure checked and found that
the indications were salisfactory and flyable".

Scrutiny of the maiulenance records of hnphal VOR indicat-
ed that maintenance personnel have been taking periodic meter
readings of the VOR equipment as well as undertaking monthly
ground checks. The last fault as recorded in the Fault Log Book of
the VOR occurred on 9th June, 1991, which was attended to and
rectified on the self same day. Thereafter, no faull has been re-
corded for this particular facillly (VOR) at Imphal Airport.

In the premises, in my view, it can safely be concluded that
question of there being any false indicalion of VOR does not arise
neither there is any scope for the pilot being misled by reason ofa
false indication.

vil) GPWS warning and Crew action :

CVR recordings have shown that GPWS warning lad (rig-
gered about six seconds prior lo the impact of the alreraft with the
hill. The FDR Data indicates that the aircrafi was descending ull
ihe time GPWS warning had come ON and thereafter the aircrat
alinost levelled off and it had started gaining height thereafter
indicating as if the Commander had initiated action lo climb up.

The evidence available shows that the aircraft impacted the
hill at an altitude of about 5200 fect and the maximuin height of
the hill at the point of impact is about 5500 feet indicating thereby
that the aircraft fmpacted about 300 [cet below the peak of the hill.


A question arose whether the aireratt could huawe cleared the
hill if action was initiated by the Pilot to ‘'Go-around! iinmediately
when the GPWS warning had come ‘ON’. In order to examine this
aspecl, simulator flights were carried out on B-737 simulator of
Indian Airlines at CTE Hyderabad using the CVR and FDR Data.
During the simulator flights the aircraft speed was maintained
around 180 kts. which was the speed at which the aircraft had
impacted. Since the aircraft was turning at an average rate of
about 3 degrees per second during the period when GPWS warning
was ‘ON’, corresponding 30 degree aircraft bank was maiutaliucd
during the simulator flight. As per the CVR read out the crew had
taken the Flaps to position 1. During the procedure (am generally
Flaps are at position 5. The simulator flighis were, therelore,
carried out for both Flap 1 and Flap 5 positions.

The simulator flights were carried out by Capt. DeCosta, a B-
737 Examiner along with Capt. R.I. Singh under the supervision of
Capt. Thergaonker. These flights were conducted in the presence
of the Court, DGCA, Dy. DGCA and Director of Air Safely. From
the simulator flights, it was observed that cven if inunediate action
was taken to pull up the aircraft and engine throttles moved
forward immediately when the GPWS warning had come ‘ON’, the
aircraft could gain a height of 100 to 110 [cet with Flaps 1 and
Flaps 5 respectively. It, therefore, indicates that even if the crew
had initiated inmmediate ‘Go-around’ when Che warning came "ON

the aircraft could not have cleared the hill.

Since the issue pertain to the pilot's reaction and has thus a
serious effect on the training aspect, I directed the Deputy Director
General of Civil Aviation, Government of India, to have a sinulator
exercise being done at the manufacturers end for terrain avoid-
ance. In accordance therewith, all necessary details were sent to
the manufacturers, and in fact, one Mr. Jaines Kerrigen, an Acro-
nautical Engineer of the Boeing Company from Seatile, Washing-
ton D.C. appeared before the Court of Inquiry as a witness with all


necessary evidence including the computerised graph for the
simulator exercise in regard to terrain avoidance. Mr. Kerrigen
slated Uhat wilh a moderate human approach to the sigual from
GPWS, the pilot could not have cleared the lerrain. Since taking
the pilot's reaction into consideration, the climb rate would be
around 90 feet per second after obtaining full throttle powcr and to
achieve full throttle power, the aircraft takes about 3.5 seconds. In
answer to a pointed question as to whether the climb rate would be
grealer after altainment of climb rate of first 90 feet per second,
Mr. Kerrigen stated that it would be again in the region of 90 feet
per sccond though there might be slight variation by reason of flap
position being flap 1 and flap 5, though however, variation would
be extremely negligible. It is to be noted, however, that originally
the simulation al the manufacturers end was carricd out on ‘Nil
Wind’ basis, but at the request of the Court special messages were
scl to the Bocing Company by Mr. Kerrigen for drawing out the
flight path on the basis of 10 and 20 knots of tail wind on the
outbound leg and Mr. kerrigen also produced the fax in regard
thereto, which however, does not show much of a difference in the
ground path by reason of the existence of the tail wind as above.
The study of the Boeing Company is already an annexure to thus
report being Annexure 'F’.

Though the aforesaid stucy indicates that ‘Go-round’ action
by crew after the warning had come ‘ON’ would not lave prevented
the accident, importance of Iminediate crew action whenever GPWS
warning comes ‘ON’ cannot be over-emphasised. When the aircratl
is flying in IMC conditions, the crew is not In a postion to deter-
miuine how close they are wilh the terrain and hence, immediate
action when GPWS warning comes ‘ON’ could save collision of
aircraft with terrain. Even when the aircraft is fying in VMC
conditions and crew may see the terrain the warning should not be
ignored since the aircraft may nol be in a safe configuration to land
i.e. the Landing Gear may nol be extended, flaps may not be in
landing configuration or the deviation from the ILS Glide Path may

be excessive. Even if crew could visually see that there is no

130


danger of collision with terrain, it is necessary to take lmmediate
action to cheek the alrcrafe configuration whenever GPWS warutig
comes ‘ON’. While Indian Airlines tave iiformed Chat their Craudniiiag
procedures require that GPWS warning should not be ignored and
immicdiate action should be taken, it is absolutely essential that
the drill of taking tnunediate action to ‘Go-around’ tn IMC condition
and to check the aircraft configuration in VMC condition should be
rigorously practiced during the training and subsequent refresher /
proficiency training and checks. The Airline should monitor this
aspect very closely so that crew react to the warning wilhout loss

of time which is very crucial in such situations.

While it is rue thal the method and mode of training seem
lo be rather rigorous and according to Capt. M.V.V. Rao in accord-
ance wilh olher global standard, but | have certain reservations in
regard to the career pattern of pilots in Indian Airlines. It is no-
(iced that young boys are recruited from open market and alter
training Uaey operate the flight as Co-pilol (P-2) in B-737 aircraft
from where, however, the same man progresses as Co-plilot om A-
320 aircrall and finally as Co-pilot on A-300 aircrall. Surprisiugly,
however, in terms of career pattern followed by Indian Airlines as
regards command endorsement jt is only P-2 in A-300 who gets a
conunaud endorsement as P-1 in B-737 and progressively as Pilot-
in-Command in A-320 and thereafter on A-300. This particular
career pattern cannot in my view stand to airy reason whatsoever
since from the conventional type (B-737) one is taken to fly-by-wire
glass cockpit as a Co-pilot and thereafter again Wransmitted to a
conventional aircraft (A-300) and finally transmitted back as Pilot-
in-Command in the conventional B-737 and thereafler from
conventional lo glass cockpit and then again lo conventional
alrcralt. It seems before drawing out Us carcer pattern there was
no strict application of mind so far as the operator (Indian Airlines)
is concerned otherwise (here would not have been a shift from
conventional to glass cockpit and from glass cockpit to conveition-
al aircraft on more than one occasion in the career of a particular
individual while acting as a Co-pilot and a Pilot-in-Command. In
my considered opinion this cannot be termed to be a very safe
career patlern and if this particular career pattern is continued |
have no hesitation to record that there will be nothing but a
compronise with the safely of air passengers. Tinie has now come


up, therefore, for the operator to restructure the whole career
pattern of the pilots so as (o be in conformity with Che salety dorms
as is prevalent Unroughout the globe. It is lo be noted, however,
that A-320 pilots (P-1 or P-2) do not fly any oUher aircraft in actu-
ality.

On the basis of available evidence, however, as regards Capt.
Halder's proficiency, | find that his Bocing 737 endorsement train-
ing was first taken up by Capt. M.S. Sharma, bul after about 2
hours and 15 minutes of simulator sorties, Capt. Sharma did not
find Capt. Halder to be suitable enough for undergoing the training
and he discontinued his training thereafter. Capt. M.V.V. Rao
upon proper scrutiny of the records maintained by the luadian
Airlines training institute, has stated that since Capt. Halder was
doing hard landings, Capt. Sharma discontinucd his training.
According lo Capt. Rao, this disconUnuance may be duc fo
comniuication gap between the traince and the instructor or
Capt. Halder’s performance being not upto the expected standards,
though however, there is no evidence available on U1is score and
the statement as above admittedly was purely on guess work of
Capt. Rao. Incidentally it is to be noted that after Capt. Sharma
discontinued with the training, Capt. Rahut was eutrusted for
training of Capt. Halder for Boeing endorsement wherein after 15
days Capt. Rahut found him fit for endorsement. It is not out of
context to note here, however, that Capt. Rahut also informed that
during his 15 days training, he found Capt. Halder coming high on
approach on turn which he corrected after five or six landings
Including the corrections of the defictencies reported by Capt.
Sharia.

On the basis of above, it therefore, appears that both Capt.
Sharma and Capt. Rahut found him deficient at the first stages on
two specific counts and as such a-doubt creeps in my mind as to
whether Capt. Halder should have been cleared for Boeing 737
endorsement without being taken up for further training so as to
give lim more cxpericnce or not. The trainer apparently felt that

there is no deficicncy in Capt. Halder. It is on this count that I
wish to pul on record that training even as per the procedure as
noted above ought to be in strict accordance therewith and there
ought not to be any laxity or any compromise wiih such a waining
toa pilot. Itis true that Capt. Sharma did not record that Capt.
Halder needs further experience before obtaining Bocing 737
endorsement, but omission to record the same ought not to be
taken note of as his assent to a new instructor to obtain Bocing
737 endorsement training.

In this perspective, therefore, |] would Hke to record my
observations that in the event of any deficiency being noticed by
(he trainer, tastead of changing the trainer further experience
ought to be given to the pilot concerned so that when he takes up
the course for endorsement, there cannot be any deficiency in the
pilot concerned. Let it be clarified that I am not trying to impute
any deficlency in Capt. Halder, but the system ought to be such so
as lo obviate such deficiencies during the endorsement training
course. This observation of nue is based mainly on the evidence
of Capt. Rao that in the normal course of events one instructor is
altached to one trainee unless the instructor is not available for
conUnuation of such training.

It is al this juncture thal my visil to Australia and Singapoie
secins to be well-worth. The training standards sel up by the
operator (Indian Airlines) and the Director General of Civil Aviation
cannot be termed to be different or deficient in any way from that
of the Qanlas or Singapore Airlines training programme. Asa
mnatter of fact, the training programme in our country Is as rigor-
ous as that of the other two countries but the system of training is
the sphere where we need focus our attention. Qantas Airlines has
evolved a course intiluled "Cockpit Resource Management Course"
(CRM). In the introduction to the CRM course, it is stated -
“perhaps the first, aud most identifiable element in Cockpit Re-
source Management training is that of using the available re-

sources jin decision making. One purpose of the CRM course is to

138


i

overconie a basic weakness that initial raining has bred into pi-
lois. Pilots have been taught to Uy aircraft as sole crew members.
CRM will teach us to use all the resources al our disposal to gather
information, review the information, analyse that information,
develop solutions, implement the decision and evaluate (he per-
formance as an ongoing process of education.

Another part of CRM training is understanding conmiunica-
tion. We will learn how to communicate with other people effective-
ly. We will learn how other people react to certain styles of
conmunication, We will learn which styles of communication
produce the best results in specific situations. We will learn about

communication withoul speaking. We will lear to listen,

As part of the understanding of communication, we will learn
about ourselves and how others relate to our slyle. We will learn
to analyse our own personalities and recognise our own strengths
and weaknesses. We will learn when to be assertive and when to
be supportive and we will learn to recognise and avoid using ag-
gressive behaviour and to see the fine linc between the supportive
and the submissive.

We will learn how to properly assess the priorilics and
channel the team effort toward cllective accomplishment of the
prime task."

According to Qantas it is not a training department plot to
impose another series of discussion ilems for licence renewal. The
course will have no examination or tests aud the ongolng training
will 10t involve CRM test, the command prorogative will be main-
tained. The object is to assist the Captain lo come to the best
decision and to train his crew to be uscful to their captain tn this
decision inaking process. The training is designed to leach them
when to speak, how to speak and if it is absolutely necessary
where not to take ‘no’ for an auswer. The idea is to practice CRM

and then to discuss the collective performance at a debricfing al


which the instructor is little more than the master of ceremonies.
To aid in the debriefing, the simulators are fitted with video came
eras aud matters of interest will be played back to Lhe crew by the
instructor in the briefing room. The debriefing will consist of (he
instructor leading a discussion whereas the crew evaluate their
own performance aided by the video play-backs. This CRM course
consis(s of various factors, namely, (i) Decision process; (it) Situa-
Ulonal factors affecting decision making; (i) Behavioural deci-
sions; (iv) Conununications attitude; (v) Leadership; (vi) The
team works. This CRM provides a better opportunity and an
understanding of the whole situation wluch would otherwise be nol
available to a flight crew while operating a flight.

Unfortunately, not an iota of evidence is available on record
before this Court of Inquiry in regard to this particular course of
Cockpit Resource Manageiecnt so far as the luidian Airlines Is
concerned. I have, liowever, learnt that some time back this par-
ticular course was in fact introduced by Indian Airlines, but for
sole reason or other the same was abaiudoned. Having expert-
enced the necessity of such a course {n Australia, | have no
manner of doubt its utility vis-a-vis the safety of air passeugers.
The video play-back has a tremendous effect on human psychology
more so when the person viewing it, is a pilot. Nobody need tell
him about the draw-backs, if there be any, since one can realise
his own mistake through observation by himsclf and the operator
would be well-advised to introduce such a course for the purpose
of an effective cockpit management during the course of a flight.

As regards the Civil Aviation Authority, it is noliced in Aus-
tralia that there is no active participation of the regulatory authori-
ty, bul its functions are restricted to supervisory nalure since the
entire safety aspect of an air travel is dealt with in an elaborate
fashion by the operator itself and the examples are galore.

As regards the proficiency checks, the CAA Australla re-
quires the pilots to have the same checks twice a year bul (he

operalor, namely, the Qantas Airways does the same checks them-
selves four times a year - this: by ttself depicts the sincerity of the

operator In (he matter of sale Uying,

As regards the check pilots, it is the operator (Qantas Air-
ways) who nominates the check pilots upon completion of the
check pilots course and the Civil Aviation Authority Australia
grants necessary certification in regard thereto afler the nonuuated
check-pilot is checked by their examiner. The CAA also monitors
the actions of the check pilots and if the latter do not conform to
the flight standards, the check pilot's authority to act as such is
withdrawn forthwith.

As regards the inilial training, it appears that the standard
of pilots proficiency is carefully controlled by proper selection at
the inilial slage. Qantas carry out psychological tests and aptitude
tests for proper coordination and reaction in a given situation. The
ab-initio pilots are selected at an age of 19 years and it is the
Qantas who send them for training to an approved training school
for which a substantial amount of money is to be paid to the train-
ing schools by the Qantas itself for carrying oul ab-initio training,
though, however, the remaining cost would be borne by the trainee
himself. The flying training al the training school is completed ina
duration of about 16 months and on completion of which the
trainees acquire Commercial Pilots’ Licence. Thereafter, the train-
ec undergoes 8 months training with Qantas on a particular type
of aircraft, us, in about 2 years time from the start of ab-inttio
training, Uhe trainees become second officers. It lakes about 5
years approximatcly lo be a first officer from he rank of second
officer and thereafter on the basis of the sellorily and on the usual
conunand training and checks the first officer obtatus Pilot-in-
Coninaid endorsement. The Fight Operation Standards pilots
about 5 in number, carry out surveillance checks of about one per
cent of the sectors which is about 25 sectors per month. The
surveillance and monitoring is now being gradually delegated by
the Civil Aviation Authority to the airline Flight Operations Stand-

ards. ‘The Flight Operations Standards pilots monitor the standard
of individual pilots - they check the check pilots, tuspect the
simulators and training Instilutes and maintain data base of pllots.

As noted above, though the CAA requires that proficiency
checks of pilots be carried out al least twice evcry year. Qantas
carrics out such checks every three months and every pilot goes
through simulator exercise every three months. A report is pre-
pared every Ume and the assessment Is kept in the computer and
retrieved for review whenever the pilot goes for promotional train-
ing or is appointed as a check captain. If during a simulator
check, a pilot fails, he is taken off fying jmumediately tll he passes
the checks. The general trend of the proficiency of the pilots is
retrieved from the computer data which may: show any deficiency
in the (raining system if it prevails. Such monitoring reduces the
failure rales and hence saves Wraining costs. The nil accident rate
of Qantas has helped them in reducing the insuraiice cost and has
improved the passenger confideice as a result of which they get
higher share of passenger traffic. While appointing check pilots,
the computer data of the pilot is scrulinised by the Flight Stand-
ards branch and it is only thereafter a pilot is taken for training as
a check pilot. After successful completion of checks by the Flight
Standards pilots, the name of the pilot is recommended to CAA tor

approval.

Onc of the most important feature of monitoring aud surveil-
lance by Qantas is monitoring of Quick Access Recorder (QAR).
They monitor the data of every fight with the help of computer
system and analyse the 50 selected parameters to find out if there
exists any deviation from the limit values. If there isa general
trend of exceedence of any particular parameter the training
division is immediately informed to find out if there is any
deficiency in the training. On implementation of remedial
measures they have been able to drastically reduce the deviation
rates. The QAR analysis has been established with the
concurrence of pilots’ Union on the condition that the name of the


crew will not be divulged and any deviation observed during the

eliminate the same. The Qantas do nol take any direct action and
it is lef{ to the Unions. They have found the system working
salisfactorily as according to them the Unions and the individual
pilots are made morc responsille to ensure that 10 deviations from

the laid down procedures occur.

During the training of pilots in the simulator, they make the
video tapes which they show subsequently to the pilots so that

they become aware of any deficiencies during their simulator train-

ing.

Any personality traits of pilots are not allowed to affect air -
line operations. Even if a pilot passes every proficiency lest but if
his personalily can cause difficulty in airline operations, he is nol
given command endorsement and he is kept only as a first officer.

In the introduction chapter of this report, I have already
delved into the role of Executive Pilots in Australia. Il is not also
out of place to note that the Execulive Pilols are allowed to fly by
Qantas only about 1/3rd of the flying done by the line pilots. In
order that Unese pilots do not suffer financially, they are kept on
fixed salary independent of the hours flown by them. In this way,
a proper balance is maintained. The minimum flying required to
be done by the exccullve pilots so as lo matitain surveillanee and
to have a feel of the operations and also provides enough time to
them to devote on the aspects of planning and moniloring the
training and operational aspects. In this way, the executive pilols
maiutain very close watch on day-to-day operations and can devote
enough time in office to handle the operational matters.

Singapore Airlines is also one of the safest airlines in the
world. There has been no accident to Singapore Airlines during
the last 30 years. The training progranune of Singapore airline is

quite similar to the programmes in India and Australia. The opera-

tor prepares the training programune of pilots and submits the
same to CAA for approval. During the training on simulator, the
aircraft flight path is plolled by computer and if a pilot is found not
reacling urgently in an emergency, the instructor would repeat the
exercise. On operators aircraft, he CAA flight inspectors check the
check-pitots and examiners of Singapore Airlines. The flight in-
spectors carry oul checks of the examiners and the check pilots
once in about two months. The airline examiners check the profi-
clency of pilots and the CAA ensures that the laid down system
works and they only do sample checks.

The airline decides on which type of aircraft a pilot will go for
training and there is no cholee of a pilot to decide which aircrait le
would go for training. A CPL holder becomes first officer after
about eight months training wilh the atrline. During the training
he can go as a second officer and acts as a supermunmiary pilot.
Before a Co-pilot can become a Pilot-in-Conunand, he should get
ALTP and acquire about 5,000 hours experience as a Co-pilot.
Thus, a Co-pilot would become a Pilot-in-conunand after about 10

years.

A pilot can fly only one type of aircraft al a time. Pilots
holding command endorsements on basic B-747-200 or 300 air-
craft cannot fly B-747-400 aircraft. Only check pilots aud examiin-
ers can fly two types of aircraft. Even cabin crew can fly only on
two types of aireralt.

The simulator training is iinparted by instructors who are
current on the type. Only recurrent training can be given by re-
tired pilots who are appointed on ad hoc basis. Singapore Airlines
requires proficiency checks of pilots on simulator to be done at
every three months.

From the study of the training and proficicucy monitoring of
pilots by Qantas and Singapore Airlines, it is noted that the airline
systcins are well laid down, followed and monitored. It is (he

airlines which takes responsibility to ensure compliance of the laid
down procedures. The CAA is there to carry out random checks.
The cullure in the airline is so safely conscious thal one cannol
think that there would be any deviation from the laid down proce-
dures. The pilots and the associations are made responsible lo
remove deficiencies observed during the monitoring. The airline,
let alone the CAA, does not have to resort to punitive actions to
enforce compliance of the operating procedures. Such a culture
needs to be developed, if we have to take a major step forward
towards the safety of aircraft operaUions. All concerned whether au
individual pilot, pilots associations, the executive pilots, the
management of the airlines and the regulatory authorilics have to
re-orient and restructure their policies and prograniunes lo culti-
vate a healthy atmosphere, the spiril of teant work and colleclive
sharing of the responsibilitics.

The other aspect of the training to pilots in the matter of
terrain avoidance in our country ought also to be emphasised. It is
to be noted that the Aviation Research and Education Foundation —
of the United States of America recommended to the Federal Avia-
tion Authority in the context of Delayed GPWS Response Syndrome
the following :

- emphasize that the only acceptable procedure
for reacting to a GPWS pull-up warning of impending
impact with the ground is to inumediately set maxi-
mum thrust and rotate to the pitch augle for maxi-
nian angle of climb;

- specify that daylight visual observaUion is the
only acceptable means for contradicting such a GPWS
pull-up warning for terrain closure;

- ensure that the airplane flight manuals and
training curricula of all GPWS equipped U.S airHnes
prescribe the aforementioned procedures for dealing
with a terrain-closure GPWS pull-up warning;

- require that GPWS equipped U.S. carriers tn-

clude a terrain closure GPWS pull-up warning iu all
initial and recurrent simulator training sessions;

145


- seta deadiine for upgrading all firsi-gencratlon
GPWS equipment to the current state of the art; and

- ensure that the miuininium terrain clearance
standards used by GPWS are compatible with those
used in establishing minimum altitudes for radar
vectors and for approach charts.”

Subsequently, however, National Transportation Safety
Board of USA also in the line as above recommended that "FAA
should tustruct all air carriers to Include in their flightcrew proce-
dures instructions which require an immediate response to the
ground proximily system's terrain closure "pull-up" warning when
proximity to the terrain cannot be verified instantly by visual
observation. The required response to this warning should be that
the maximum avatlable thrust be applied and that the aircraft be
rotated lo achieve the best angle of climb without delay."

After considerable deliberation, (he Federal Aviation Admin-
istration, USA, also responded to the need of the hour and imple-
mented the reconunendations.

Both in Australia and in Singapore, the pilots are trained to
react immediately with the triggering of the Ground Proximity
Warning System. In Australla, during (raining of pilots lor
command endorsements, random GPWS warning is injected on to
the computer at the siniulator and the pilot's reaction is noled by
the computer. Such areaction thereafter is scrulinised and if
thought fit, further training is imparted on to the pilot in regard
thereto. The importance of adhering to GPWS is made known to
the Pilot-In-Command. Similar is the situation in Singapore.

It is heartening to note also the Director General of Civil
Aviation In his anxicty in regard to this parUcular branch of Air
Safety issued an Air Safety Circular in January, 1992 to the follow-
ing effect :-

SUBJECT: GROUND PROXIMITY WARNING SYSTEM RESPONSE

In the last two decades, the world over, it has been
noticed that there is a tendency on the part of the pilots
to ignore Ground Proximity Warning resulting in avoid-
able accidents. It has been the cause of worry and

146


Ag

concern amongst the Civil Aviation Authorities the
world over. Circulars have been issued by FAA as early
as 1981 in regard to procedures to be followed when a
ground proxtmity warning is sounded in the cockpit of
the aircraft.

Pilots have a tendency to ignore ground proximity
warning, based on their experience of false triggering of
this alarm. When they had responded to the alarm in
other causes, it had been too late. In India also, it has
also been observed in a few cases, that pilots have
ignored Ground Proximity Warning with disastrous
consequences.

It is, therefore, hereby ordered that the following
procedures may be followed by all pilots :

DQ In regard to terrain closure "pull up" alarm when
the pilot has no accurate visual observation as a
basis for contradicting it, the moment the alarm
is sounded, the pilot may execute corrective action
by immediate application of maximum available
thrust while simultaneously rotating the airplane
to achieve the best angle of climb. The rate of
rotation must be consistent with the existing
Slight parameters of the aircraft concerned so as
not to exceed the critical angle of attack.

ti) Pilots should not inhibit GPWS warning system
unless there is positive contra indications by
accurate visual observation.

ii) Air carriers should review their operations
manuals to incorporate appropriate flight crew
training procedures to train pilots for action with
respect to GPWS signals. The airline carriers may
incorporate even in the training programmes
appropriate routines for training, to respond to
GPWS alarm. They should also test the pilots to
such GPWS response during checks, trainings and
other routine exercises which they are required to
carry out in the simulator from time to time.

iv) Airlines may immediately carry out a check of all
the GPWS equipment on the aircraft to ensure
their integrity and proper serviceabllity to elimi-
nate false alarm.

From the records produced before this Court, it appears that

the copy of the Circular was duly sent to all the Civil Aviation

Operators operaling in this country and the operators including

Uie Indian Airlines did in fact respond to the same confirming

having taken the action in terms therewith. As regards the contir-

mation of Indian Airlines is concerned, the saine is quoted herein-

below:

"We confirm having taken the action as under :

(a) The circular has been brought to the notice of Iving
crew through our Regional Operalions Manager.

(b) = The circular is being incorporated as Appendix I to

{c) Direclor of Training, CTE, Hyderabad has been advised
for faking sultable action vide our letter No HOP /23-
7863/5232 dated 20th January, 1992."

Iam, however, constrained to note here that even though the
Operalions Manager (Training), was available in the witness box,
the implementation by the Director of Training in regard to the
circular issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation has not
been placed on record and as matter of fact on a pointed question
from the Court, the Operations Manager simply stated that their
training procedures require that GPWS warning should not be
ignored and imuuediate action should be taken. While theoretically
this may seen to be otherwise in accordance wilh the circular, but
there is some alount of difference between the theory and the
actual practical training course. No evidence whatsoever is avail-
able on record to show the introduction of a curriculum in regard
to the pilot's action on the triggering of the GPWS, neither their
training manual or a syllabus in regard to has been produced
before the Court - this state of affairs cannot be stated to be very
encouraging.

In imy view, it is high Ue that due importance be attached
lo the triggering of GPWS. The drill of taking tmmediale action to
go round tn IMC condition and to check the aircraft configuration
should be rigorously practiced during the training. Proper syllabus
be prepared in regard Uherelo and the instructors be directed to
treal this parUcular aspect as an independent subject of their
training and the proficiency checks should also take note of pilot's
reaction to the triggering of GPWS.

14.1 (b) Air Traffic Control Officers :

The personnel of the acrodrome discipline of National Air-
ports Authorily are being recruited from the colleges al two levels,
viz. those of Aerodrome Assistants and Acrodrome Officers. The
entry qualification of Aerodrome Assistants is degree in Science or

149


Diploma in Engineering and that for the Aerodrome Officers ts
degree in Science or a graduation in engineering or a holder of
Conunercial Pilots Licence. | have been given to understand,
however, that many of the officers recruils are also Post Graduate
degrec holders in science.

Re Training Programune for personnel recruited at Assistants level :

Ab-initio Training :

Duration : 4 months.

Subjects Taught : Basic Concepts of Aerodrome Con-
trol, Theory and Practice including
handling of normal traffic density

situations, and a few emergencies.

Other allied subjects such as Mete-
orology, Air Navigation, Comumunica-
tion Procedures, Navigational Aids,
Acrodrome and Ground Aids, Fire
Fighting aud Rescue, Airframe and
Engines, Air Law, and Morse Recep-
lion.

All (he subjects are Caught only to a
basic level at this stage.

On successful completion of the training, the candidate is
posted as an Aerodrome Assistauil al one of the stalions, where he

mainly assisis the Officers in performance of ATC duties.

Aerodrome Control Course :

This course is taught to thie Aerodrome Assistants aller they
gain experience of about 6 to 7 years.

150

Duration : 16 weeks (Previously 14 weeks)

Subjects Taught : Theoretical and Practical Traimng in
Aerodrome Control, including in
High Density Traffic situations, and
Handling of all emergencies.

The allied subjects are also a taught
in a detailed manner.

On successful completion of this course, the official becomes
eligible to be promoted as Assistant Acrodrome Officer, as per
his/her semlorily and as per the number of vacancies available. He
will then undergo OJT and acquire Acrodrome Control rating.

Refresher and Approach Control Course : (Planned now)

After being promoted as Assistant Aerodrome Officer, the
official is being sent to CATC, as per the seniority and the planning
al the CATC, for the Approach control course.

Duration : 10 weeks.

Subjects Taught : Mainly Approach Control (and Area
Control) in Theory and Practice,
including in High Density Traffic
Situations and handling of all
emergencies.

A refresher and updation of the
other allied courses will also be
given during the course.

Re Training Courses for Acrodrome Officers :

The ab-initio Training for Aerodrome Officers recruited dl-

rectly from the open market is for a duralion of 12 months, divided

into three modules.

1 Module :
(4 months) at CATC

li Moduwe :

(4 months)

IN] Modules :
(4 months)

Theoretical and Practical Training in
Aerodrome Control, including in
High Density Simulated Traffic
Situations and Handling of emer-
gencies.

Other allied subjects such as Mete-
orology, AGA, Air Navigation,
Conununication Procedures, Naviga-
tional Aids, Fire fighting and Rescue
Services, Morse Reception are also
taught.

On the Job Training al one of the
Interational Airports to the level of
acquiring an Acrodrome Control
Rating, and familiarisalion with
other ATC units such as Approach,
Area, Radar.

Theoretical and Practical Training in
Approach Control, including in High
Density Simulated Traffic Situations
in all weather conditions, and

Handiing of emergencics.

A continuation is made tn the teach-
Ing of other allied subjects such as
Meteorology, Air NavigaUion, and,
also Air Law, Airframe and engines
(Technical).

Afier Completing the CATC Course successfully, the Acro-
drome Officers are posted to one of the International Airports,
where they are given on the job training, leading fo acquisition of
the various ralings, as per the procedures enunciated in DARA
Circular 2 of 1990. The period of on-the-job training depends on
the rating being acquired, the station of posting.

Board for Examination:

The board of examination in Practicals in Aerodrome Control
for the Acrodrome Officers consists of three members, one a Direc-
tor from the International Airports, a Deputy Director from the
international airports, and the Chief Instructor ATC, CATC.

The rating boards at the international stations for Lhe var-
fous stallions are as per those cnunciated in the DARA Circular 2 of

1990.

Common Courses for those recruited initlally as Acrodrome Assist-

ants as also Aerodrome Officers :

The Assistant Acrodrome Officers, after nearly 7 to 8 years of
service in this Cadre of AAOs, get promoted to the rank of Acro-
drome Officer depending on the seniority and number of vacancics.

The Inter-se seniorily between the direct recruit Acrodrome
Officers and (he Departmentally promoted ones, takes place at the
level of Aerodrome Officers and their promotion avenues thereafter

are follow a comunon route.

Specialised courses such as Search and Rescue Mission
Coordinator and Assistant Mission Coordinators, Radar (Terminal
and Area) aud others are open for those of Aerodrome Officers rank
and above.

The minimum qualification for the Radar Course is at least
three years of service in ATC with one year's experience in Ap-
proach/Area Control after acquiring of thesc ratings.

Procedure for issue of ratings at small stations after the
prescribed pertod of on-the-job training, is governed by DARA
Circular 1 of 1992. With the implementation of this, fhe system of
issuc of ratings has been laid down for all the airports in India
under the N.A.A.

IL is noteworthy that a new computer-based state of art
technology ATC Radar Simulator has already been conunissioned
and integrated into the training at the Civil Aviation Training
College (CATC) at Aliahabad. When | visited the CATC a few days
back, the Radar Simulator equipment was shown to me which is,
in fact, being used for imparting training to Air Traffic Controllers
both for approach and area control in order to maintain safe and
expeditious flow of traffic. I was told that training of Air Tratlic
controllers on live aircraft at (he airports is so expensive that it
cannot be afforded together with the other possible interference to
the regular aircrafl operations and it is for this reason that radar
simulator has been introduced which simulates the exact condi-
tions of fights of aircraft, radar equipment, radio communication
channels, inter-unit ground coordination channels and thus pro-
viding realistic situation to the trainees. It is indeed a noteworthy
project since a trainee can learn through mistakes which is not
otherwise possible in actual field operations. I have been informed
by AVM H.M. Shahul, Member Operations of the National Airports
Authority Ghat this project of CATC is under UNDP and is to
progress to increase the capacity and capability of the training
institute. Equipments worth US $ 1.455 million, have already


been added which includes major training aids like radar simula-
tor, tower simulator, desk top publishing system, miicro-wave train-
ing kits and personal computer system. As regards (he objective of
the project, it includes course standardisation : imparting instru-
mental techniques to the trainers : development of new courses
such as Search & Rescue, Aeronautical Information System, Air-
port Management, Instructional Techniques ctc. As a matter of
fact, | was introduced to two American consultants who are now
stationed at Allahabad to guide the CATC instructors to achieve
the project objeclive. I was informed by the foreign consultants
that the radar simulator which has becn installed at CATC already
is the best in the world and is comparable to any available at other
training institutes in the world.

During my visit to Australia and Singapore, I discussed the
subject of training of ATCOs wilh the Civil Aviation Authorities of
these countries. It was noted that in Australia the Air Traffic
Controllers undergo two years initial training consisUng of theory,
practical and simulator exercise. After this they have to pass
written examination and undergo on-the-job training during which
they handle air traffic under supervision of check ATCO. After
they pass the checks, they get licence and rating in Tower, Ap-
proach, Area and Radar Control. Ifa traince fails during iniUial
slagcs of training, his training is discontinued. In order to monitor
proficiency of the ATCOs, they undergo proficiency checks every six
months. These checks are carricd out even if the ATCOs continue
to work in the same posilion. Every ATCO also undergoes medical
examination once in two years if below 45 years of age and once
every year if more than 45 years of age. Whenever an ATCO is
transferred to a new station, he undergoes nccessary training and
checks relating to the procedures of the new station before he is
allowed to work independently at that station. Every ATCO Its
given familiarisation flights approximately once a year. Qantas
Airways gives six passages to the ATCOs lo go and study the Air
Traffic Control procedures of other countries. CAA even charters
aircraft to give flight famillarisation to the ATCOs. The check

155


ATCOs are appointed on merit to fulfil the criteria laid down by
CAA. The ATCOs during their initial training are also trained in
inctcorology and whenever required they give their own metcorolog-
ical observations to flights.

While the Air Traffic Control in Australia is exercised by the
Civil Aviation Authority, major airports are under the control of
Federal Airports Corporation. The ATC and ground aids including
safety services are provided by Civil Aviation Authority. Category-I
ILS is provided at about six major airports and at other airports
facilities like VOR, DME and NDB are provided. Oily manual RVR
is provided at present and RVR equipment is being installed at
Sydney airport. Al major airports, radar along with the transpon-
der has been provided. All Control Towers at major airports are
manned by only rated ATCOs. In addition to the ATCOs, there is
always a supervisory controller who does not, in fact, handle the
radio Lransinission, but lakes a back seat to have an over-view of
the entire situation Uhough at times he himself transmits on radio
transuussion to assist the raled ATCO at the Control Tower. It is
ai this junction that I would like to point out that on a suggestion
from the Court the Natlonal Airports Authority submitted that (he
presence of a supervisor at the Control Tower may dampen the
acliveness of the Controller. Ido not, however, accept sucha
suggestion and record my observation to the effect that the
presence of a Controller will not only improve the situation but will
also cnure to the benefit of the Controllers at the Control Tower
for proper and effective management of the Air Traffic Control
System.

The situation as above also prevails in Singapore. There are
three Controllers and one Supervisory Controller at the Control
Tower for effective Iimanagement of the Air Traffic Control. The
presence of the supervisor not only enures to tlic benefit as noted
above, but during heavy tratfic tis a positive help to the Air Tratlic
Controllers. It also avoids the fatigue of the Air Traffic Controller
at the Control Tower.

156

In Australia all Air Traffic Controller are licenced by CAA. If
an ATCO does not work in a unit for 14 days or more, he has to
work under a Check ATCO for some time depending upon the
period he has not worked in a unit.

Turning attention to our ATC system, it is placed on record
that on the basis of available evidence on record and the literatures
available in regard thereto, the procedure does not seem to be
lacking in any way so far as the theorclical aspect of such a train-
ing is copcerned. Practicability of the situation, however, Is slight-
ly dilferent from its theoretical aspect and in that regard I wish to
record certain observations of mine vis-a-vis the training procedure
of the ATCOs and the ratings given to the ATCOs.

Admittedly Air Traffic Control in smaller airports are being
effected by non-rated officers - a situation which is lotally unwar-
ranted. I remember having reconumended while dealing with the
Guwahali crash in regard to a Vayudool aircraft that the National
Airports Authority should ensure thal only trained and rated Air
Traffic Controllers should handle the traffic but that reconuncida-
tion scems to be on paper only. As a matter of fact, however, |
understand that the Government has thought it fit not to iinple-
ment the same. I am at a loss to find such a stale of affairs. For
convenicnce sake, the Recommendation No.18 of the Report of the
Vayudoot F-27 air crash at Guwahati and the Governnicut’s reac-
tion thereto is noted hereinbelow :

Reconunendation

"(xvili) National Airports Authorily should clearly lay down the
duties and responsibilities of the Aerodrome Assistants and Air
Traffic Control Officers. it should be ensured that only trained and
rated Air Traffic Controllers handle all traffic."

Governments Reaction :

"Reconunendation No.18 : In recommendation No.18, National Air-
ports Authority has been advised to lay down the dutics and


responsibilities of the Aerodrome Assistants and Air Traffic Control
Officers. The Court has reconunended that it has to be ensured
that only trained and rated Air Traffic Controllers handle all traffic.
It is mentioned here that the Aerodrome Assistants are trained
persons who are in the process of acquiring operational experience.
It is to be ensured that Uhe ATCO does not abdicate his responsibil-
ily and leave everything to the Aerodrome Assistant, who although
trained, is not competent to handle air traffic control independe:it-
ly in all types of weather and approach conditions."

IL seems that the Goverment has taken note of the conduct
of the ATCO and his training but has not dealt with the rating of
the ATCOs at all. In the normal course of events, however, it is
deenicd that the Government has applied its miud and deliberately
left it out, but considering the seriousness of the matter, I should
have thought that the Goverrunent should give some reason as to
the non-acceptance of this recominendation in regard to the rat-
ings of the ATCOs. While it is true that once the Goveriment has
not accepted a recommendation specifically, a High Court Judge
holding an air crash inquiry ought not to recommend it for the
second time, but considcring the salely aspect f cannot but to note
here my anxiety in regard to the ratings of the ATCOs manning
independently the radio transmission al any airport. It is a safely
requirement and as such Government should reconsider its deci-
sion in regard thereto. There should not be any compromise with
safely standard - as noted above. Huiman ves are precious and
there should not be any laxity or sense of complacency in so lar as

the safety sphere is concerned.

It is not out of place to mention Unat in my earlier report of
the F-27 air crash submitted in March, 1989, I have also recom-
mended the licensing of the ATCOs : this particular reconuenda-
tion, even though has been accepted by the Government, but no
step whatsoever has yet been taken in regard thereto. Recouunen-
dations are made by the Courts of Inquiry upon proper delibera-
tions and on appraisal of the entire situation and once the Gov-

ernment accepts such a recommendation, there should not be any
time gap for its implementation.

Coming back to the factual aspect of the matter in regard to
the Air Traffic Control at Imphal Airport, if ts scen that the traffic
was handled by one Mr. P. Sengupta, an Air Traffic Control Officer,
independently without being banked by any rated officer by the
Board of the National Airports Authority. The evidence of Mr.
Rastogi being the Sentor Aerodrome Officer Is a revelation to this
Court. Mr. Rastogi stated that Mr. Sengupta is the only fully quall-
fied ATC Officer for Lmphal and to a pointed question as to whether
Sengupta was a rated officer, there was a definite answer to the
affirmative. On being further asked as to who has rated Mr.
Sengupta, the answer of Mr. Rastogi was - "by my predecessor". 1
ain at a loss to find that how a single individual can rate an officer
giving independent charge of Air Traffic Control at an airport. Mr.
Raslogi explains, however, that at the smaller airporl no elaborate
procedure is followed and il is the senior officer who is competent
to judge whether the junior officer has faniliarised himsclf with the
local procedure, local condition, local traffic pattern, local envi-
ronment and the local topography and alter observing that the
junior officer is working well and that he is able to handle the
Radio Transmission well then he is allowed to handle the R/T
independently after giving him the rating. No documentary evi-
dence, however, was produced before this Court as to the cerlifica-
tion by the senior officer. Mr. Rastogi further elaborated (he policy
of the National Airports Authority to the effect that density of flight
is the only eriteria in the matter of adaptation of the rating proce-
dure at the Control Tower. Mr. Rastogi went on to say Unat Na-
tional Airports Authority can afford to do away with the rigours in
regard to the independent handling of R/T by the rated officers in
low density flight operational airports. It is the definite evidence of
Mr. Rastogi that "it is only the number of operations, the number
of aircraft operaling at any airport which ts important to decide
whether he Is to be given more claborate training before handing
over charge independently at an international airport or he cau be

lianded over charge of a smaller airport after the senior officer who
js present certifies that he is competent to take over the works at
the airport. In thls context, Question No.72 and ils auswer ought
to be noted and which is reproduced hereinbelow :-

"Q.72 : That is why | ain asking you that the level
of flight only would Be considered by
Nalional Airports Authority as to what sort
of training would be given to the ATCOs.
If there are more traffic, more rigorous is
the raining If there are less traffic, less
rigorous js the training - is that so ?/ Thal
is correct.”

On the basis of aforesaid, therefore, it appears that the
National Airports Authorily maintains dual standards, one tor
lugher flight density alrports and the other for lower flight deusity
airports. In my considered view, maintenance of dual standard
ought not lo be resorted to and all ATCOs should be rated before
allowing them to handle R/T independently irrespective of flight
density. Rating cannot be effected only for the purpose of handling
more aircraft as it has an inbuilt safety device which is also other-
wise required for low flight densily airports. There cannot be any
conipromise wilh safety and Uhis policy of the National Airports
Authority thus in my view ought to be dispensed with and same
standard be made applicable to all airports irrespective of the traf-
fic position in regard to the ratings of the ATCO. In the event of
transfer of the ATCO to a bigger airport further training may be
fmiparted to the ATCO but that docs not mean Chat the required
training need nol be given to an ATCO by way of a rating ii) smaller
airports.

I would not like to be misunderstood about the capability of
Mr. Sengupta as an Air Traffic Controller, but the observations as
above only pertain to the policy of the National Airports Authority.
The call-outs given by Mr. Sengupta to the aircraft cannot be
termed to be wrong as such though slighUly betler phraseology
could have been used, particularly in regard to the clearance for
direct outbound. No strict exception however, can be taken to

such a clearance as above by reason of subsequent call ouls by
ATCO being in order.

The other aspect of this issue ought also to be uoted at this
juncture. No refresher courses are arranged for the ATCOs. The
National Airports Authority obviously thinks it fit enough nol to
provide any refresher course for the ATCO, but in my view, the
ATCO has an equal if not more important role to play in the matter
of air safety vis-a-vis the pilots on board the aircraft. The licensing
of ATCOs would definitely bring in a much more healthier and
safer situaUion since in that event the DGCA being the regulatory
authority would be able to formulate and provide adequate safely
regulation jn regard thereto. Incidentally ibis to be moted Ghat in
my carer report in regard to the Vayudoot air crash at Guwahati,
I specifically recomuncnuded that the refresher courses should be
arranged for ATCOs at least ouce a year. Even though that
recommendation has been accepted by the Government, but no
step whatsoever has been taken by the National Airports Aulhorily
to implement the same. [ understand that the reminders from the
Director General of Civil Aviation’s Office has yielded no result
whatsocver.

The availability of ATC tape is also of very greal importance
for the purpose of monitoring (he proficiency of (ac ATCOs. The
National Airports Authority would be well advised to have random
checks of the ATC tape so as to ascertain (he proficiency of the
ATCOs.

It is not, however, out of context to note the third aspect of
this issue viz. the famillarisation flights for the ATCOs. The Air
Traffic controllers are the persons who guide the aircraft in all
eventualitics and they therefore, should have proper appreciation
of the cockpit instruments as otherwise there is likelihood ofa
communication gap between the pilot and the ground control.
This possibility would not, however, be there in the event of proper
knowledge about the cockpil panel instruments. In the premises

161


faniiliarisation with the equipments so far as the ATCOs are con-
cerned, in my view, is a question of primary requirement. The
Nalional Airports Authority would be well advised to modulate the
necessary details with least possible delay. This observation of
mine is based upon the fact that the days of Dakotas are over and
we are in a modern jet age with very high speed fly-by-wire aircraft.

14.1 (c) Electronic/Technical Officers :

The personnel of Technical discipline of NAA currently are
being recruited from the colleges at two levels namely Electronic
Assistants and Electronic Officers. The entry qualifications of EA
is Diploina in Electrical/Electronic stream or B.Sc (Physics Main).
for Electronic Offficers a degree 111 Engincering (Electronics) or its
equivalent is mandatory.

Training Courses - Basic

The basic Wwaining of Electronic/Techuical Olficers is lor 22
weeks. They are trained on basics of VOR, DME, ILS and other
communication equipments. On suceessful completion of (raining,
they are sent to field stations to work under experienced officers
only on general equipments like HF transmitter recciver, VHF
equipment and terminal building equipments like tape recorder
ete. After gaining proficiency on these equipments and experience
of G6 months in the field a EO/TO is proficient lo carry out inde-
pendently the requisite maintenance and repair on the above
equipments. At this stage they do not handle specialised nature of
tasks like ILS, DME, VOR, RADAR etc.

Specialised Training

After galning experieice not less than 2 years EO/TOs are
seul for specialised training on RADAR, ILS, VOR, DME, Uight
calibralion equipment, AMSS, computer applications, Aeronautical
Mobile services on HF RT. Duration of this waining is 6 weeks.

162


Proficicney Asscssiment

The board comprising of Director from Hyrs. + Clief Instruc-
tor Communication from CATC and one more Instructor from
CATC test the Officers on completion of 22 wecks as well as 6
wecks courses to assess their proficiency and declare them compe-
tent. A certificate Is being issued presently by Principal, CATC

both qualifying them Initially and also on specialised equipments.

Proficicucy on the ground

a) After basic course of 22 wecks and gaining the expericuce for
6 months the EO/TOs are competent to undertake the tasks
of maintenance of general equipments like HF RT, VHF
equipments and tape recorders.

b) On completion of specialised course of 6 wecks these officers
work under experienced and qualified officers on equipments
Uke Radar, ILS, VOR and DME for 8-12 wecks to gatn prolfi-
clency and declare independent to handle the equipments.
In fact, independent posts as EO/TOs to take the charge of
stations are mosUly those officers who are experienced and

proficient to handle such equipments where (hey are posted.

Electronic/Technical Assistants

EA/TA are given 22 weeks initial course basically to work
under the supervision of qualified EO/TOs. EA at no stage hold
independent charge at any field or station. Their basic training
includes imparting training of Trausinitters, receivers, test equip-
ments aud jobs like soldering etc. The TA course is desigued to
appreciate the problems involved in the maintenance of both
preventive as well as gencral maintenance and lend services to the
qualified EO/TOs in their conduct of trouble-shooting and mainte-
nance of the equipments.

163

Proficicncy Assessinent

Like in the case of EO/TOs their proficiciucy assessment is
done by three members comprising of local board from within
CATC and assess accordingly.

Assistant Technical Officers

ATO is not direct recruitment but a promotee from EA/TA.
An EA/TA after completing al least 5 years becouics eligible for
promotion to ATO depending upon the efficiency and in their own
turn. For this purpose they are sent to CATC for qualifying: course
which is of the duration of 12 wecks. Like-in the case of Acro-
drome discipline, those officers who do not make the grade are
sent back and here also these are given 3 chances to make the
grade. On gaining requisite proficiency an ATO Is allowed to work
on equipments like tape recorders, VHF/HF, NDB, X-Ray baggage
and some specialised equipmicnts. In small stalions where there is
oily NDB or X-Ray Baggage, an ATO also posted as independent
charge of the station.

Updatement

The courses, like in the case of Acrodrome discipline, are
updated periodically by the CATC after getting requisite approval
from the Hqrs. The UNDP project association with CATC aims for
enhancing the capability of Technical discipline.in the NAA.

General

I understand that in the past, there were two streams in the
Technical stream at the time of entry namely Technical Assistants
and Communication Assistants and secondly Pechutcal Officer /
Communication Officer. Technical Officers used to deal with

(echnical disciplines like matnienance etc. whereas conunuinication

164

officers dealt with basically communication aspects of the opcra-
lions. This was the age old pattern followed by the DGCA. After
the formation of the Nationa! Airports Authority, it was felt as |
have beeu informed that some highly and well-qualified technical
officers were being lost in general stream of Communication disct-
pline and hence the new concept known as Electronic Assistants
and Electronic Officers was introduced for better utilisation of
human resources. This changed system as appears, had started
about two years back and five batches of students of Electronic
Assistants as well as Electronic Officers have passed out from
CATC so far. The Gth one is undergoing training currently.

It is to be made clear, lhowever, that maintenance of these
highly sophisticated ground equipmeiits being the navigational and
lauding aids for the aircraft, should be effected in a highly profes-
sional manner and only competent and efficient people ought to be
engaged therefor. The system maintained by the Enginecring
Departinent of Indian Airlines by way of written schedule checks, I
feel, ought to be introduced in the mnatter of regular maintenance
of these equipments. The same would not only cnure to the proper
maintenance of Khe equipment but also obliterate the possibility of
human errors in the matter of maintenance of these soplusticated
equipments.

14.1 (d) Cabin Crew Training :

During the entire course of hearing, both at Calcutta and at
Imphal no submissions have been made on behalf of the cabin
crew in spite of notices being served on to the union of the cabin
crew of Indian Airlines. It is only in the morning of 27th April that
my Secretary has made over the original of the affidavit filed by the
cabin crew union. Seathing remarks have been made in the atfi-
davit as regards the training procedure of the crew members of
Indian Airlines by reason wheretor [ had no other option but to
send a questionaire to the Director of Operations through Capt.
P.M. Jog anid I also received the reply thereto on the sanic day.

165

It has been stated in the affidavit that :
i) There is no standardised training in Indian Airlines.

ii) The duration of each course of training progranune varies as
per the whims and fancies of the management of Indian
Airlines since there fs no adherence to the definite time and
lecture hour for different subjects of training.

iii) There ts no control whatsoever on the part of DGCA In re-

spect of the training of the cabin crew.

iv) No fire drill training is provided to the cabin crew by reason
of non-availability of a Mock Aircraft’.

v) The management of the Indian Airlines does not also deen it
fit to take the assistance of Air India for traintug of their
cabin crew inembers.

The Indian Airlines, however, in their reply calegorically
disputed the above noted submissions of the union and stated that
there are prescribed syllabus for cabin crew and the Indian Airlines
have abinitio training course which js the basic training course
given after the cabin crew are recruiled and before ihey are sent on
flight. The duration of this course is 8 wecks on ground training
for a batch of 25 trainees. Four flights on cach type of aircraft are
given as on-the-job training. Apart Uierefrom the ludian Airlucs
stated that yearly refresher courses are conducted lor all cabin
crew at the regions and there is a prescribed syllabus for such a
refresher course. The duration of the refresher course is three
days for a batch of 10 to 12 cabin crew. The Indian Airlines stated
that in addition to these courscs, the airlines has conversation
courses for (he new aircraft as and when required and the duratlon
of these courses depend on the quantum of information to be

imparted to the trainees. As regards the fire drills, Ghe answer was


in Use affirmative and so is in regard to ditching drill and evacua-
tion training to the cabin crew. The syllabus for cabin crew train-
ing was also sent along wilh the reply of the Indian Airlines which
provide a 60 hours course and cainot but be termed to be satisfac-
tory in nature. On the score of training of pilols and ATCOs and
other technical officers, I have recorded my observations that there
is some amount of difference between theoretical scope of training
and actual imparting of such a training to the trainees. ‘The cabin
crew themselves fecl it that the training imparted is not sufficicit,
the management should, therefore, see to it that the aining to be
{mparted on to the cabin crew ought to be standardised aud there
ought not to be any departure from the training standard as pre-

seribed.

While dealing with the matter two other issues which have
been raised by the Union oughil to be noted, namely, Ue FDTL and
the fatigue of the cabin crew. As regards FDTL., the affidavit point-
edly records that the cabin crew members ought to work ata
stretch for 11 hours in a calendar day. The affidavit goes on to
record, however, that this 11 hours a day duty time was arrived at
though bilaterally tn the agreement with the operator and the
unfon but in fact it becomes too much of a burden for the cabin
crew to work for 11 hours a day and the same might, therefore,
endanger the flight safety. There cannot be any maiuicr of doubt
that 11 hours a day duty for a cabin crew may turn out to be very
sltranuous but the operator has stated that normally they are
rostered in such a way that the duty time does not exceed 5 to G
hours a day and it is only when the standby cabin crew are pulled
out due to exigencies they may be required lo work upto a maxi-
nium off 11 hours a day as per the agreed FDTL. It, therefore,
appears that under the normal circumstances the duly hour being
not more than 5 to 6 hours, ito exception can be taken and it ts
oily in emergency situation that this FDTL is taken recourse to by
the operator, but (hese are exceptions and exceptions cannot
termed to be the rules as such I do not find any serious objection
in regard thereto al least UN such ime a new agreement is arrived

167


at by and between the union and the management of the Indian
Airlines. The agreement has a binding force and it is not for this
Court to comment thereon rather for the parties to the agreement
to change the terms.

The issue as regards the fatigue is also co-relaled with the
FDTL and by reason of my obseervation in regard to FDTL I do not
wish to record any finding in regard to the issue of faligue as well
excepung, however, stating herein that the operator should look
into the issue without much loss of time.

14.2 Frequent Flying on one route by the pilot :

While it is true that familarisation with a particular
terrain is required for a safe flight, but frequent flying in one route
is likely to give a bit of a over-confidence to the pilot, though
however, Capt. Mehta while deposing before the Court stated that
question of being over-confident docs not and cannot arise so [ar
as flying is concerned. Considcring, however, the human mind
and the psychology, | am not in a position to concur with the
slalcment of Capt. Mehta. It came on record thal Capt. Halder tad
opcratcd 36 flights from Calcutta to Imphal within a period of
preceding six months. A question had arisen as to wliy he was
operaUing so frequently on this route. Capt. Mehta in this regard
stated that if a conimmander wants to fly on the same route, there is
no bar in the Indian Airlines regulauions. He also clarified that in
case of Boeing 737 aircraft they have only two or three command-
ers at the Calcutta base and other Boeing 737 pilots come from
Delhi and Bombay for operating flights in Calcutta region. If these
comuanders do not turn up then the pilots based at Calcutta may
be sent on one pariicular route and one sector only. When he was
asked that ifa pilol wants a particular route, do they give that
particular route whenever he wanted; Capt. Melita replied that if
the commander requests it can be accepted. He also clarified tliat
any change in the roster dulies cannot be done by the pilot himself
without the permission of (he roster -tncharge.

168

Shri S.K. Srivastava, Deputy Manager Flight Operations,
who was incharge in the roster Section of Bocing pilots al Calcutta
at the relevant period and who was rosting Boeing pilots was asked
how Capt. Halder had flown so many flights to Imphal, it was
stated that some flights were given to Capt. halder on his request
and some were given by them depending on the prevailing silua-
(ion. Shri Srivastava informed that Capt. halder sometimes used
to request for flights to Lmphal. He, however, never asked why
Capt. Halder was asking for flights to Imphal.

Considering the above, in my view, Capt. Halder had a bit
loo much of familiarity with the terrain which may have brought
about a feeling of over-confidence in him which by all standards
ought to be done away with and the operator would be well advised
to give due consideration to this aspcct.

The observations as above also find support from the intra-
cockpit conversation at 07:08:44 UTC to the effect "You are exaclly
- - This is 25 miles Roger Aye Ekta Hill Range, Oye Ekta Hill Range
- Do Tor Majh Khanne” (This is one hill, that is another hill and tn
between the two), which goes to show how familiar the pilot was
with the terrain and the pilot knew exactly what he was doilg.
This indicates that he was giving distance call-outs and positioning
bimself not on the basis of any instrument reading or estimate
calculations but on some ground features with which he was very
familiar.

14.3 Pre-flight Medical Checks of Crew:

Though I have already dealt with this aspect of (he matter in
regard to the pre-flight medical check up, but I wish to made cer-
tain gencral observations in regard thereto and hence a special

mention is being madc.

As noted above human lives are precious and it is on one


parlicular person thal these lives are dependent on board the
aircraft as such this particular person being the Pilot-in-Conunand
of the aircraft should be under no inconvelence of whatsoever
nature. Proper mental equillbrium ought to be maintained and for
this purpose this pre-flight medical check has been envisaged by
the Director General of Civil Aviation and the operator has been
asked to assure such a state so far as the pilot is concerned. Et is
now on record (hat the Indian Airlines has the system of pre-tlipht
medical checks by doctors i the roll of Indian Airlines. The certif-
icaics produced before the Court in regard to the two pilots of the
ill-fated flight (IC-257), however, leave much lo be desired in the
matter of pre-flight medical check-ups. The proforma has been
made oul on which the doctor is to give a certificate, but apparent-
ly the doctor does not have the time to write even at the columus
specified for alcohol checks. A plain look at the cerUficate show
that the certification is to the detection of abnormality in the pilot
oly, since it records "NAD" (No Abnormality Detected) - what did
the doctor mean by that - did he expect that the pilot would behave
abnormally in the morning when he has come to operate a flight -
did le expect that the pilot would be so drunk thal he will not be
able to walk properly - did he expect that the pilot would be using
languages which cannot and does not befit a genUeman : it never
occurred to the operator that this caunot be a proper certifteation
for a proper medical check up. The adininistration of the operator
ought to rise up to the occasion lo See that the proforma envisaged
for medical check-ups is being dealt with by their medical officers
in the proper spirit for which it has been so devised. It is not out
of context to note that some days back a newspaper report ap-
peared recording therein the protests of the pilot in the matter of
monitoring the alcohol checks by DGCA officials. I should have
thought that the pilots themselves would volunteer for sucha
check as otherwise the cntire ethics of tying would be in jeopardy.
In any event, I do not see any justification of such criticism or
protest since itis only for public sately Ghat these checks are
monitored. Be that as it may, the operator would be well advised
to look into this aspect of the matter also and see that this medical

check up is effected in a manner as is conducive to sate flying
rather than in a slip-shod fashion as is evident from the pre-flight
inedical cheek reports of Capt. Shekhar Halder and Capt. D.B. Roy
Chaudhary.

It will, however, be worthwhile to record that in Australia
there is no pre-flight medical check-up. On being asked about the
danger of not having a morning pre-flight medical check-up,
prompt came the reply from the Qantas that the pilots of the
Qantas Airways are so self-disciplined that such a check is not
required. The Airways has framed a regulation that no pilot
should have a drink after 8 O'clock in the evening if they are oper-
ating any flight next day morning till noon time and the pilots
themselves stop drinking as a matter of fact before that time and

under no circumstances shall continue with the drink aller 8 p.m.

If the operalor can introduce such a culture in its system, I
ain also inclined to believe that no pre-flight medical check-up
would be needed since trust and confidence on to the pilots can
bring home itself the striclest of regulatory uncthods.

14.4Search & Rescue

Search and Rescue are the two most important aspects in
the civil aviation industry in the country. [am constrained lo say
that the National Airports Authority has had no training pro-
gramme in regard thercto until very recently. Now, of course, a
training programine with a search and rescue course objective has
been framed and the course duration being - four weeks and entry
level is only from experienced Aerodrome Officers and Senior
Aerodrome Officers - a welcome course undoubtedly, since human
lives may be lost by reason of delayed search and rescue. Tine
has now come up for consideration of all the agencies involved in
the Civil Aviation industry to sil down and evaluate some proce-
dure so that this particular issue of search and rescue is given its

duc hnportance. Though the para-military forces and the local
police adininistration may be approached for necessary assistance,
but thal does not mean and imply thal the agencies tuvolved with
the Civil Aviation of the country will be a mere passive speclator
whilst others cracking their head to effect the search and rescue of
the viclimis of an air crash.

Mr. Rastogi in course of his evidence, in uo uncerlain terms
stated that it was no part of his duty to take steps in the matter of
search and rescue in the event the aircraft accident lakes place
beyond the airport vicinity. This attitude of the Senior Acrodrome
Officer, I am sorry to note, cannot be appreciated. This shows that
the Scnutor Acrodrome Officer lacks a seuse of responsibilily to the
safety of the passengers. I understand that-as early as 1976-77
the Civil Aviation Directorate, Government of India has published a
booklet entitled ‘Organisation and Procedure for Search and
Rescue of aircraft in distress’ containing the detailed procedure
including a chapter on the definitions of the expressions used
therein. The appendix |] to the booklet itself provides the names of
the officers who should be responsible for Uie search and rescue
operation in the event of there being any unforlunale incident and
invariably it is the Reglonal Director of the Region who have been
staled to head the scarch and rescue service. The National Air-
ports Authority being a successor of the then DGCA excluding the
regulatory functions ought therefore be made responsible for sucht
a rescue operation and I fail to appreciate the evidence of Mr.
Rastogi being the Senior Aerodrome Officer to the effect as noted
above viz. he has no responsibility for search and rescue in the
event the rescuc operation is outside the airport area since it will
then be the duty of the State authority to organise the search and
rescuc. | record my ulter dissatisfaction to this pardeular piece of
evidence of Mr. Rastogi.

Incidentally IU is lo be noted that it took quite some Une to
locate the wreckage and had there been a Emergency Locator
Transinitier (ELT), this delay in locating the wreckage could have


been avoided. Though it is true, however, that there were no
survivors and the deaths were instanlancous, but tt is always
advisable and better for all concerned (o locate the wreckage at the
earlicst possible opportunity and as such installation of an ELT is
of primary importance. I understand that the Director Gencral of
Civil Avialion has already issued a directive about the installation
of the ELTs in all aircrafts and for passenger aircrafis the Ume
limit given by the Director General is upto 30th April, 1992. I
hereby record my appreciation for the steps taken by the Director
General in that direction. I have, however, been tnformied Ureat
though the operator (Indian Airlines) has installed an ELT iustru-
ment in their aircraft, but the same is water activated type only
and not impact activated. The Director General, however, should
make it a point to see that, in fact, the impact as also ithe water
activated system are introduced in all passenger aircraft as carly
as possible and in default of such a step by the operator, necessary
regulatory steps be taken withoul any compronuse whatsocver

since it is an essential requirement for search and rescue.

14.5 Accident Prevention Cell

In the introduction chapter of this report, | have stated that
monetary compensation or a word of syimpathy will not do - we will
have to rise up to the occasion to stop the recurrence of these
accidents which is otherwise avoidable in nature. I also recorded
that the time and hour has come for us to do our ulmost to save
such fatalities - this observation of mine is not out of context at all
since it is always better to take a preventive action rather than to
do a post mortem action. Our endeavour should be directed to
avoid such accidents and with that perspective in the earlicr report
I reconnnended that there should be a new dedicated cell for acct:
dent prevention work. I understand thal the cell has been created
by the DGCA and has been duly approved by the Minisiry, but
what surprised me most, is the personnel of the cell - there ts only
one post of an officer sanclloned by the Government for the cell. I

do not understand as to how sanction to one post could be made

173

in a cell which is supposed to be working for prevention of acci-
dents. TU has come in evidence that even the airports have nol
been inspected for years together, far apart of having a lotal super -
visory capabilily of the cell for prevention work. Implementation of
the recommendations of the earlicr Courts of Inquiries is alsoa
part of the duty of the special ceil and by reason of the non-avail-
ability of the personnel, the status in regard thereto is also far from
salisfactory. The other function which the special cell ought to
discharge is the monitoring of the FDRs, DFDRs and CVRs - is that
humanly possible for one person to do for the prevention of acei-
dents - the auswer cannot but be in the negalive. It seems (hat the
Government has not appreciated the proper spirit with which this
parlicular recomunendation was made as otherwise the action of
the Government in implementation thereof would not have been in
the same fashion as it has, in fact, been effected. 1 hereby empha-
sise again that there should be a proper and adequately stalfed
special cell under DGCA for the prevention of accidents and the
Government should rise upto the occasion and to take effective

sleps for such prevention of accidents.

14.6 Control Tower Equipments

a) ATC Tapes

ATC tape is one of the primary instruments located at the
Control tower, it has to discharge definite functions and an effec-
live method to cross-check the transmissions {rom both the air-
craft as also from the ground. This also serves the vital need of
monitoring the actions of both the pilots and the ATCOs.

Unfortunately, however, the evidence disclosed before the
Court that the ATC tape at lmphal Airport has not been comumis-
sioned for the last about eight years. Il is indeed a sorry state of
affairs - can we in (his couutry afford to keep an expensive equip-
ment in unserviceable condition for a period of eight years when
there is so much of economic constraints in the national financial

position - this is apart from the safety aspect and ils ulililty as a
Control Tower equipment - in my view, the answer cannot but be
In the negative. Nobody scems lo be bothered about the equip-
anent lying at Imphal Airport for such a long period of time. Mr.
Raslogi has staied that it required some spares. The Senior Acro-
dronie Officer ought to be slightly more careful aud particular tn
regard to the equipments at the Control Tower. The matter,
however, needs further investigation by the National Airports
Authority and appropriate steps be taken against the delinquent
officer or officers.

b) Status Indicator Lights

It seems to be a perpetual problem in the North-Eastern
region of the country. While | was investigating the Guwahati alr
crash, the same state of affairs as regards (he status indicator
lights existed - if the National Airports Authority thinks it fil
cnough not to maintain the status indicator Ughts at the Control
Tower then why have an indicator light - obviously the NAA has tlic
impression that unserviceability of the status indicator lights does
not really matter. 1, however, have a different opinion in Cre
matter and in my view, maintenance of the status indicator lights
at the Control Tower is imperative as that would provide an
immediate indication as to the serviceability of the landing and
navigational aids at the airport. It helps tie ATCO to conimunicate
the status to the pilot and as such is a safety requirement and the
National Airports Authority would be well advised to sec the serv-
iceability of the status indicator lights at the Control Tower.

c) RVR Indications

Runway Visual Range (RVR) equipment is a definite assist-
ance in the matter of assessment of the visibility in (he runway
direcHon of (he adrport area. ha (he absence of RVR equipment, the
ATCO shall have to depend on the subjective assessment of the
visibility of the Meteorologist of the airport, bul with a RVR equip-

iment the indications at the Tower would appear and as such more
or less correct visibilily prevailing al that point of time would be
transmitted to Une pilot of the airerafl. This undoubtedly would be
avery great assistance to the pilots as also to the ATCO at the time
of instrument approach and landing during unfavourable weather

conditions.

14.7 Implementation of carlier Recommendations

During the course of hearing, Capt. Bagchi appearing for the
Air Passengers Association laid special emphasis in regard to the
implementation of the earlier recommendations. I record my
concurrence with the subnission of Capt. Bagchi. Even at the cost
of repetition, it is to be emphasised that Courts of Inquiry deal with
the matter in very great detail upon evidence and on perusal of
necessary documents - it applies ifs mind and considering the
requirement of the situation - the recommendations are made. It
is, therefore, a prime requirement that the recommendations so
accepted by the goveriument ought to be implemented without any
(ine lag and with utmost expedition with all sincerity and in the
spirit in which it has been recommended. The iaiplementation of
the reconunendations ought to be effected though by the Govern-
ment, but the Director General of Civil Aviation has a definite role
to play in the matter of bringing home the acceptance of the
reconunendations by the Government. The Seerctary in the Minis-
try of Civil Aviation should have periodic revicw as regards the
implementalion of such recommendations. It ought to be a joint
and concerted effort of all concerned in the Civil Aviation industry
of the couniry for safe flying of the passengers.

14.8 Operator's Flight Safety Directorate

In accordance with the normal practice of an Airline opera-
tor, the Indian Airlines is also on record has a Flight Safety Direc-
torale. T emphasise the word "On record". This cimphasis ts by
reason of the fact that it existed only on record and not on actuall-
ty of the situation. No evidence has been tendered before this

176

Court of Inquiry as to the functioning of the Fight Safety Director -
ate excepting for the last few months. As a matter of fact, the
doctunentary evidence disclosed that prior to September, L991, 10
meeting of the Flight Safety Committee in the Directorate of Flight
Safely of the operator did take place - Is it a conceivable situation
that an organisation like Indian Airlines will not have any meeting
of the Fight Safety Committee for a period of three years - the
answer obviously would be in the negative.

Iimust, however, appreciate the gesture and sense of duty of
the present Director of Flight Safety in the matter of production of
this piece of evidence before the Court. It is for the first time in
three years that the present Director Capt. P.M. Jog has brought
about a meeting of the Comunittee in his Directorate so as lo bring
a healthy situation tn flight safely in the country so far as domestic
operalions are concerned. For convenience sake the documentary
evideuce nade available to this Court is reproduced hereinbelow:

INDIAN AIRLINES HQRS.
(Directorate of Flight Safety)

26th Sept. 1991
Sub: Flight Safely Conunitlee Mecling held on 12th Sept., L99L.

This Flight Safety Committee Meeting was held after a period
of 3 years. All the invilecs excepting O.M., Madras, were present,
After aE Arend inecting for regular Ageuda potuts, all the
OMs along with Director of Training, Director of Operations and
Director flight Safety continued mectiig after the lunch time.
During this meeting Director iigat Safety pointed out that the
number of accidents/incidents that are taking place is alarming
and asked the invitees to discuss on the subject.

Most of the members agreed that in order to improve the
safely records of the Corporation, it is a must, that the flights are
monitored for standard operating procedures.

For this Directorate to monitor any deviation from the stand-
ard operating procedure it is a must, that we should gel the {light
Recorders (CVR/FDRS) in time and also the readings of such Flight
Recorders must be relable. However, it is to our ulmost dismay,
that we find such required Flight Recorders are either not made
available In Ume or data is not rellable. We have time and again
raised memos and letters to the Meera Directorate, with
copics to you regarding non-availability of Flight Recorders and its

177

reliability. However, we do not find any improvement. Under the
circumstances it is rather dificult for this Directorate to maintain
the required vigil.

it was also agreed In the meeting that OM’s and Dy. OM's
will conduct series of observation flights. Such checks will not be
less than 10 per month.

The undersigned also suggested that in order to develop
personal relationship between senior Conumanders and line Pilots,
small baiches of pilots for each Dy. OM may be formed and such
baiches must meet at least once in 10 days. Such meetings will
not only develop personal relationship between the junior and the
senior pilots but also will help in getting the feedback of any short
comings which may be existing. This also will develop OM's agreed
that this sort of teams will be formulated from the month of Octo-
ber and will start functioning.

This is for your information and suggestion, if any.

Sd/-
(Capl. P.M. Jog)
Director Flight Salety

Flight Safety Directorate of an Airline operator is a necessary
requirement for internal monitoring of thelr owu performance
vis-a-vis the passengers safety. The operator depending upon his
experience evolves the safety method in regard to the compliance of
the safely regulations as cuunciated by the Directorate under the
Director General of Civil Aviation. There shall have to be an intro-
spection and the operator should realise (he various salety aspects
in passenger flying - can it be said that the operator has been
doing things in accordance with the expected standard of flight
safety - on the basis of the documentary evidence disclosed before
this Court, I am afraid the answer cannot but be a positive ‘No’.
The entire Directorate if I may record should be revamped and
restructured since a feeling of insecurity is gradually gaining
ground in the minds of the air passengers in the country.

I cannot help but record my observations that the Flight
Safety Directorate though needs to be headed by a very expert:
enced pilot but after taking over charge his {lying similar to Chiat of
a line pilot should not be permitted but he should be allowed to
obtain compensatory allowances as if he was, in fact, flying. As a

178

matter of fact, the executives of the operator ought not to be asked
to fly as they are now flying. While it 1s true that Capt. Mehta
being the former Operations Manager, Calcutta Region, in no
uncertain terms stated that the executives though flying have
enough time even otherwise to look after the institution as a whole
and to fraime the policies of the operator for sale {lying of air
passengers. | however cannot concur with the evidence of Capt.
Mehta. The company has formulated a policy of 6S flylng hours in
a month for the Hne pilots as against the maximum of 125 hours
as appears from the Aircraft Rules. The executive pilots, it is in
evidence do invariably fly more than 65 hours as they do not have
the FDTL for 65 hours, though however il shall have to be within
the prescribed limit of 125 hours as noted above. Can an execcu-
live pilot after say flying nearly about 70 te 80 hours a month
devote much time and energy for the purposes of administrative
works - I have my definite reservations aboul the same. Consider -
ing the process of thinking and the time required for uplifting the
standard of flying if the concerned executive ts busy 1 flying only".
Somebody should be made available to devole some time and
energy for the betterment of the organisation in all iis spheres, be
it operational, enginecring, commercial or safely. The system
prevalent, however, does not have such an opportunity. The
executives obviously would be flying to slalions which provide for a
night halt and if two such flights are taken in a weck that would
mean an imply that the concerned executive is not available at the
. Station for a period of four days in a week - can an organisational
set up be improved in the event of a deparunental head being away
from the station for a period of four days - I am afraid even to a
conunon man the answer would be in the negative. The procedure
prevalent in Australta as noted earlier in this report ought to be
considered at this juncture.

Time has now thus come for appraisal of the whole situation
so that flight sately in any way be not in Jeopardy. Incidentally tt is
to be noted that Atreraft Manual as published by Government of
India though elborate in nature but does not, however, contain any

179

note or regulalion as regards the air safely and considering the
situations prevailing in the civil aviation industry in the country, in
my view, {tis high time that the legislature may ponder over it
afresh to jucorporate soine rules relating to air safety tu the Air-
craft Rules ilself.

14.9 Present System of Accident Investigation

During the course of hearing, a doubt has been expressed as
regards the inethod of investigation of accidents Including the
appointment of Inspector of Accidents. In terms of Rule 7] of the
Aircraft Rules framed under the Aircraft Act 1934, the Director
General may order an investigation of any accident involving an
aircraft and the Rule prescribes the method and mode of investiga-
tion, the powers of the Inspector of Accidents have been laid down
under Rule 72. This appointinent of Inspector of Accidents pertain
to any reportable accident and Rule 75 authorises the Central
Government to have a formal invesligation if it is found (o be so
expedicnt. The language of Rule 75 is clear and unambiguous.
Rule 75 provides that where it appears to the Central Government
that itis expedient to hold a formal tivestipation of an accident, il
may whether or not an investigation or an inquiry has been made
under Rule 71 or Rule 74 by order direct a formal investigation to
be held - it therefore appears that the legislature has coulerred
power on to the Central Governimeuit irrespective of an earler
investigalion by Lhe Inspector of Accidents to hold a formal invest-
gation. There is no conflict neither there is any difficulty in the
matter of constituUing a Court of Inquiry for the accident, since not
all accidents are being investigated by constitution of a Court of
Inquiry by the Central Government. The expressions "whether or
not an investigalion or an inquiry has been made under Rule 71 or
74", makes the position amply clear.

The tegislalive intent ts clear enough tu Rule 75. Tn iy view,

considering the inunediate need for maintenance and prescervations
of materials, appoin&nent of an inspector is of utmost importance.

180


Ihnmediately after the accident if the materials are not collected,
there is every likelihood of the evidence being lost since some
amount of delay in the matter of formation of the Court cannot be
avoided. The notification shall have to be published upon consid-
eration of certain details which cannot be done immediately on the
happening of the accident. Considering the above, the legislature
also has left it to the discretion of the Director General of Civil
Avialion in regard to (he appoinunent of an Inspector of Accidents.
In my view, no exception can be taken to the present system of
accident investigation rather | would like to pul on record that
without the appointinent of an Inspector of Accident, it would be a
near impossibility to coine to a definite finding by reason of the
unavoidable time lag. It is to be noted, however, that there ts not
even a remote possibility of any conflict between the report of the
Inspector of Accident and that of the Court since immediately on
formation of the Court of Inquiry the Inspector of Accident acts in

14.10 Regulatory Functions of D.G.C.A.:

Prior to the formation of the National Airports Authorily, the
entire Civil AviaUon chapter was being monitored by the Director -
ate under the Director General of Civil Aviation, but afler the
formation of the Authority as above, there is bifurcation of the
powers of the Directorate including some of the regulatory func-
tions as well, though however, the Directorate under the Director
General of Civil Aviation continue to remain the regulatory authori-
ty of the Civil Aviation of this country. In my view, however,
though National Airports Authority may continue to discharge its
functions as has been laid down in ihe statute constituting the
National Airports Authority, but there should be in addition to the
authority a regulatory authority so that the entire civil aviation
industry can be brought under the vigilen( supervision of (he
regulatory authority. During the course of hearing, it has come to
light that airport minima is one such sphere wherein the DGCA

has no role to play in fixaUion of the same. The Directorate of the
Director General of Civil exists for safe flying in and around and
over the country. Airport minima is a safety measure which
should also come within the powers of the regulatory authority.
Preparation of ILS chart is another sphere wherein the intervention
of the Directorate under DGCA cannot be undermined. These are
all safety measures and there ought to be some such supervision
by the regulatory authority as otherwise in the event of an untfor-
tunate eventualities there would be an altempt to shift the respon-
sibility from onc to the other. Necdless to say and as I understand
that it is neither feasible nor practicable for even the Directorate to
function with its depleted staff pattern - aerodromes adinittedly are
not being inspected for operational standards for years together.
Regular monitoring of FDRs; DFDRs; CVRs and ATC tapes cannot
be effected in the manner as Is expected. The cntire organisation,
therefore, uceds restructuring and revamping lo facilitate the
Directorate to discharge its regulatory functions. Incidentally it is
not out of context to note that various other Courts of Inquiries
including my earlier report lighlighted this aspect of the matter,
but unfortunately, however, no step as yet has been taken by the
Government in that direction despite acceptunce of the recomumen-
dations by the Government. I wish to put on record that this
aspect of the mattcr ought to be looked inlo and be dealt with
wunost promptitude so far as the Government is concerned, as
there cannot possibly be any compromise with the safely of the
public at large. It is further to be noted that with the increasing
alr transport activity including coming into existence of the Air
Taxi operations, the role of DGCA cannot in any way be under-
mined and the Government would be well advised to rise up lo the
occasion so that the Directorate functions effectively and in the
true spirit in which it was formed as carly as 1927.

14.11 Formation of an Independent Air Safety Board :

Alter a series of falal accidents in the last three years in
which three jets of Indian Airlines and two aircraft of Vayudoot

182


were involved in which a few hundred precious lives were lost,
there is a growing concern amongst the travelling public of this
country that all is not well with air safety. While it is appreciated
that strenuous efforts are being made by the DGCA in inculcating
a seuse of discipline amongst the air crew and improving the
maintenance standards of the airlines, it cannol be galusald thal
there are limitations to the DGCA due to various constraints which
have been polited out elsewhere tn this report. ObDservatious liwe
also been made on the functioning of the Directorate of Flight
Safely in the airlines. A new dimension is felting added to the
aviation sector of Unis country by the opening up of the skies to the
private air taxi operators. It is understood that most of these
operators are using relatively older generation of aircraft procured
on lease from outside India. It has also to be appreciated that a
very careful watch has to be kept on the operation of these air
taxics as they would not have all the facilitics required for excel-
Jeuce in maintenance and adequacy of air salcly.

Taking all these factors tnto accouil, itis considered neces-
sary parUcularly in the context of growing volumes of air traffic in
the country and the travelling public must also be well talormed
and be apprised of the measures taken by the Government, the
regulatory authority and the airlines ought to ensure their safety.
It has also to be noted that unlike in the case of other modes of
transport, a major air accident could also affect innocent citizens
on the ground. In order to achieve the purpose of having a close
interaction between the people who use air travel and those who
provide it, apart from the regulatory body which cannot always
inter-act with the public, it is considered necessary to form a body
consisting of experts, prominent members of the travelling public
and those involved in the investigation of air accidents who could
periodically meet and have intensive inter-action with all the
agencies connected with the air travel such as the DGCA, the
Alrports Authorities, the Alrlies and above all the Ministry of Civil
Aviation. It is to be noted that this body would not otherwise
involve itself in the day-to-day functions, but would function as a

183

body to improve the air safety in the country and the pertodic
inter-action with all agencies connected with air travel would
enable also the travelling public to feel confident that all agencies
are taking adequate steps and measures to ensure their safety.

FINDINGS OF FACTs :

The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness and was
maintained in accordance with the approved maintenance
schedules. The aircraft was fully airworthy prior to its

departure from Calcutta and during the course of the entire
flight.

The flight crew had appropriate and valid licences to operate
the flight. Both the pilots have been medically fit throughout
their flying career.

The weather at Imphal at the time of crash was - visibility 7
Kms., Clouds 3/8 800 feet, 5/8 1800 feet, 1/8 cb 3000
feet. 8/8 10,000 feet - which was above the opcrator’s
weather minima for an ILS approach at Imphal.

The ATCO had passed to the aircraft the weather prevailing
at 0630 UTC but had not passed the weather of 0700 UTC
which was same as of 0630 UTC except that 1/8 ch 3,000
feet was not prevailing at 0630 UTC. The cb was however,
located in the North-East direction of the airport whereas the
aircraft approached form South-West direction. The upper
wind at 3.1 Kms (10,160 feet) estimated by India
Meteorological Department at 0600 UTC was 120°/10 Knots.

The landing and navigational aids (ILS, VOR & NDB) at
Imphal Aerodrome were functioning normally on the day of
the accident. Locator Beacons at ILS markers however, have
not been provided. The last calibration was effected on 5th
June, 1991 and was valid on the date of the accident.

Status indicator lights of ILS were not functioning in the
Control Tower on the day of the accident and had, in fact,
been in such a state for quite some time past.

DME co-located with VOR had not been installed till the day
of accident even though NAA had received the equipment at
Imphal in July, 1991. The DME, however, was subsequently
installed and made operational on 29th November, 1991.

Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) is a helpful
navigational aid but cannot be termed to be an essential
navigational aid. Non-availability of DME at Imphal has not
contributed to the accident.

Installation of Automatic Direction Finder - AD-200 at
Imphal Airport is not considered necessary on the threshold
of 21st century, more so by reason of the availability of VOR
which is a modern navigational and more effective pilot
interpreted aid.

At Imphal there is no equipment installed to provide Runway
Visual Range information which would be of great assistance
to the pilots for carrying out instrument approach and
landing during unfavourable weather conditions.

ATC multi-channel tape recorder supplied by Stencil
Hoffman of USA was procured by National Airports Authority
and received at Imphal in early 1983, but has not yet been
installed even after nine years of procurement.

By reason of non-availability of the ATC tape at the Control
Tower at Imphal, performance monitoring of ATCOs has
become an extremely difficult.

ATCOs are not having sufficient familiarisation flights.

Air Traffic Control at Imphal Airport on the day of the
accident was manned by an officer not formally rated by
National Airports Authority, though the concerned ATCO had
been informally authorised to handle the air traffic by a
senior officer at Imphal.

The flight crew gave incorrect call-out to Agartala ATC that
they were overhead Agartala VOR even though the aircraft
was nowhere near Agartala VOR.

The flight crew gave wrong altitude call-outs to Imphal ATC
on a number of occasions during descent and let down
which can only be termed as an act of indiscipline.

The aircraft never came overhead Imphal VOR even though
the ATC had asked it to report overhead.

The flight crew reported approaching overhead VOR even
though the aircraft was about 14 miles away from Imphal
VOR at that point of time.

The flight crew had initially intimated to Imphal ATC the
estimated time of arrival as 07:16 hours UTC. However,
after setting course directly to Imphal from Comilla they
revised their ETA to 07:12 hours UTC.

The possibility of the flight crew being misled by reason of
false indication of the VOR is ruled out.

The flight crew by virtue of not reporting overhead VOR and
turning right much shorter of the same, instead of turning
left overhead VOR for tear drop entry, lost the time reference
required for carrying out ILS let down.

Till the time of impact the aircraft was not on localizer or
glide path.

There was total lack of discipline and professionalism during
the flight on the part of the flight crew by not adhering to the
operational flight plan as also the ILS let down chart together
with wrong position reports and altitude call-outs.

The Pilot-in-Command did not adhere to the ILS let down

chart but instead seems to have relied upon the ground
features with which he thought he was extremely familiar.

The flight crew committed a grave error of not realising that
early commencement of descent to 10,000 feet and turn to
right without coming overhead VOR would musplace them in
the hilly terrain further away from the airport.

No emergency condition was communicated by the flight
crew during the entire course of flight till the time of impact.

The co-pilot throughout the flight remained as a mere
Passive and mute spectator to the deviations from the
prescribed operational procedures.

Tail wind of even 60 knots during outbound leg could not
have drifted the aircraft to the place where the crash has
taken place if the ILS let down procedure was adhered to.

About six seconds Prior to the impact, GPWS warning came
‘ON’, but it was not Possible to clear the hill ahead even if
the crew had taken immediate action to climb.

The crash occurred on the Thangjing Hill about 300 feet
below the hill peak and at a distance of 20. 19 nautical miles
from VOR Imphal Airport as per the distance estimate given
by the Directorate of Survey (Air).

There was no evidence to indicate any Sabotage or inflight
structural failure of the aircraft.

Search and rescue operations were carried out in a manner

as is expected in the circumstances as were prevalent on the
date of the accident at crash site.

16. PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT
—— ee Ae OF THE ACCIDENT

The accident occurred by reason of a grave error on the part
of the Pilot-in-Command in not adhering to the operational flight
plan and ILS let down chart and not realising that his early de-
scent to 10,000 feet and turning right for outbound leg without
Teporting overhead VOR would result in loss of time reference and
as such misplace him in the hilly terrain. The Pilot-in-Command's
action may have been influenced by his extreme familiarity with
the terrain.

RECOMMENDATIONS
SVAN NDATIONS

The Indian Airlines should reiterate to all its pilots that they
must meticulously follow all stipulated operational proce-
dures.

The Flight Safety Directorate of Indian Airlines should be
restructured so as to Introduce a fight Standardisation cell
which would be responsible for surveillance checks on board
the aircraft as also simulator training and monitoring of
other related Operational aspects. This should, however, be
in addition to the routine proficiency checks as is prevalent.

The operator should carry out random checks of Cockpit
Voice Recorder, Flight Data Recorder and Digital F light Data
Recorder and the DGCA should ensure compliance thereof.

The training Programme of the operator ought to inculcate a
Sense of cockpit discipline amongst the pilots in order to
ensure smooth and efficient operation of the Night with

" meticulous observance of stipulated procedures.

Indian Airlines training Programme should emphasise the
need for correct call-outs by Pilots and under no circuim-
stances the pilot should indulge in wrong and inappropriate
call-outs.

Indian Airlines should include an excrelse in the syllabus for
simulator training as regards the pilot’s reaction to the trig-
gering of the GPws.

“

Co-pilots training ought to match with that of the Pilot-in-
Command since the former is acting as a safety pilot and
Inay be required to take charge should it be so required.

The operator ought to hold flight safety meetings regularly
and the entire Directorate of the operator requires restruc-
turing and revamping so as to be more effective in the matter
of flight safety.

Periodic meetings between the Operations Manager, Flight
Safety, and the Line Pilots ought to be arranged so as to
derive benefit from the experiences of other pilots.

Proper liaison be maintained between the Flight Despatch,
Operational Personnel including engineering and the Flight
Safety Directorate of the operator by way of meetings at
regular intervals.

The career pattern of Pilots as is existing today with the
operator (Indian Airlines) ought to be reviewed in the light of
observations made in the report.

The operator through their training programme ought to en-
courage and impress on junior pilots and convince them that
they not only have the right but indeed have the responsibili-
ty to speak up if they disagree with senior pilot's action.
They must be reassured that they will not suffer displeasure
or recrimination for doing so.

The senior pilots must equally be told that if they do not
accept or indeed ridicule a junior pilot's actions in this
regard then their own behaviour is unacceptable to the air-
line.

The operator must inculcate in the whole body of the pilots
the philosophy of team work while operating a flight.

Cockpit Resource Management Course ought to be intro-
duced without any further loss of time and if necessary even
an outside management consultant may be approached for
proper and effective guidance in regard thereto and all pilots
are to undergo the same course in order to promote better
cockpit management for safe flight operations.

The cabin crew training programme should be standardised
and no departure from the prescribed training syllabus
ought to be permitted.

The operator should ensure that all mandatory documents
are upto date and carried on board. The DGCA Airworthi-
ness Officers should carry out random checks and monitor
compHance of the same.

All Boeing 737 Aircraft operating in the country and regis-
tered by the Director General of Civil Aviation should be
fitted with Digital Flight Data Recorder as also Emergency
Locator Transmitters capable of impact as well as water
activation.

Calcutta Airport being a major Boeing 737 aircraft mainte-
nance base, ought to be provided with all necessary spares
and trained personnel for effecting proper checks upto
Check-I level so as to avoid Carrying forward of any snag and
for other similar stations the situation ought to be reviewed
forthwith.

Proficiency checks of Air Traffic Controllers should be carried
out periodically at least Once a year and the Air Traffic
Controllers should also undergo refresher courses once a
year.

The performance of the ATCOs ought to be monitored regu-
larly by the National Airports Authority and all remedial
measures be taken immediately and if required further train-
ing be arranged for without any financial repercussions.

Periodic monitoring of ATC tape so as to check the proficien-
cy of ATCOs should be conducted by the National Airports
Authority and the DGCA should also monitor the same by
way of random checks.

The National Airports Authority should arrange for familiari-
sation flights for all ATC personnel more frequently in con-
sultation with the operators operating in the country.

Periodic medical check-ups of ATCOs ought to be introduced
uunmediately.

National Airports. Authority should envisage specific duty
hours for the ATCOs taking into consideration the fatigue
factor.

The training programme of ATCOs ought to contain a sylla-
bus through which the ATCOs can famillarise themselves
with the cockpit instruments relating to navigational and
ground aid facilities.

National Airports Authority should Carry out calibration of all
navigational and landing aids at the frequency stipulated by
ICAO.

National Airports Authority should ensure that only trained
and formally rated Air Traffic Controllers handle the traffic.

Locator beacons at ILS markers may be Provided at hnphal
airport and also at other hilly terrain airporis.

ATC tape recorder ought to be provided at Imphal Airport
without any further loss of time. As a-matter of fact, this
particular facility should be made available to all airports
having scheduled Airline operations.

The National Airports Authority would be well-advised to
prepare periodic maintenance schedules for all navigational,
conununication and landing aids and Salety services. Period-
ic checks be carried by only trained personnel.

As far as practicable there should be two Air Traffic Control-
lers available at the Control Tower during the flight move-
ments at least at stations where all ATC functions are
combined in one unit as also at the Area and Approach
Control Units where radar facility is available.

The National Alrporis Authority must make available the in-
strument let down charts to the DGCA for its approval.

Instrument let down charts of airports specially in the hilly
terrain ought to be reviewed by National Airports Authority
in consultation with the operator and seek the approval of

also cloud base at Imphal Airport as also other airports in
hilly terrain.

The Flight Inspection Directorate of DGCA should be restruc-
tured to carry out frequent proficiency checks of the airline
pilots on various types of aircraft and the ATCOs.

The Air Safety Directorate of DGCA should be strengthened
to make it more effective in discharge of its vital functions
relating to safety of aircraft operations.

The one man Accident Prevention Cell-currently existing in
DGCA is totally inadequate to discharge the vital role of
accident prevention and as such it should be restructured
and strengthened without any loss of further time.

DGCA should have an separate air accident prevention cell
manned by persons not below the rank of Senior Air Safety
Officer at every major airport of the country.

The implementation of the earlier recommendation in regard
to licensing of ATCOs and Aercdromes should be effected
forthwith by creating an adequately staffed new wing in the
Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation.

The DGCA should ensure inspection of the aerodromes at
least once in two years.

DGCA should coordinate meetings with the Operators and
the National Airports Authority in regard to Flight Safety
inclusive of engineering aspects.

The DGCA being the regulatory authority ought to be re-
vamped so as to be able to discharge its regulatory functions

198

J also thank the Acting Consui General of India at Sydney
Shri Dingliana for his assistance in every sphere at Sydney and his
active interest in regard to safety of Indian Civil Aviation Indusiry.
I also record my sincere thanks to Shri Ratan Ghosh, Manager, Air
India, Sydney and Shri S. Ranganathan, Regional Accounts

Manager, Air India, Sydney, for their definite assistance whilst I
was at Sydney.

The sincerity with which the manufacturer of the aircraft,
namely, Boeing Company responded to the queries of this Court of
Inquiry needs special praise. The Company never showed any
reluctance to assist the Court in every sphere. Special representa-
tives were sent to meet me both al Dethi and at Calcutta and the
exercises undertaken at the request of the Court cannot but be
praiseworthy. Mr. James Kerrigan an Aeronautical Engineer was
specially flown from USA to Calcutta for the purpose of assisling
this Court of Inquiry by his oral evidence and documentary presen-
tation before the Court. I record Iny appreciation to the Company
for such assistance.

Capt. D.S. Mathur, Director Operations, Air India, and Capt.
J.R. Trilokekar, Deputy Director Operations, Air ludia, were trou-
bled by me on more than one occasion, but their sense of duty and
Sincerily for the purpose prompted them to bear with me ungrudg-
ingly and I record Iny appreciation and sincere thanks for their
iuvaluable service to this Court of Inquiry specially for taking the
trouble of Simulating the flight path on the basis of the Hight data
of the ill-fated aircraft and other flight datas on more than one
occasion.

During the course of investigation, I came to know Shri H.S.
Khola, Deputy Director General of Civil Aviation more closely and
in him [ find an efficient, knowledgeable, devoted and hard-
working official of the Central Govermment. I sincerely wish him all
Success in life and pray to Alnighty that Shri Khola should con-
tinue to act with such devotion for all times to come.

199

I will fail in my duty if | do not mention the untiring effort of
Shr Satendra Singh, Director Air Safety in the Office of the Direc-
tor General of Civil Aviation. In hin I find an ever -obliging gentle-
man who is not only hard-working but sincere to its core and 1 also
wish lim all success in life.

Shri R.K. Paul, Regional Controller of Air Safety, Calcutta,
and the Inspector of Accident in this case has left a very dcep
{impression in my mind for his sincerity and hard-work together
with his desire to fulfil all the needs of the Court. Shri Paul has
helped me to an enormous extent to bring to a fruitful end of the
task assigned to me. The report submitted by him is also very
comprehensive and assisted me in every sphere of my inquiry.

Shri A.K. Sinha, the Secretary of this Court of Inquiry has
also been of very great assistance to ime. Troubled as he was
during the entire course of Inquiry, he never lost his patience. His
profound knowledge of Air Traffic Control System has also left a
deep impression in my mind.

In the body of the report I did mention about the effort of
Manipur Adventure and Allied Sports Institute (MAASIJ), in the
matter of search and rescue. I sincerely hope and pray to Almighty
that Shri N.J.K. Singh along with his young friends should contin-
te lo render this type of invaluable humane service and I wish the
organisation all success.

My sincere thanks also go to the Border Security Force
personnel as also the personnel of Manipur Rifles and Central
Reserve Police Force, without whose assistance the search and
rescue would have been a near impossibility. I also record my
sincere appreciation of the services rendered by the Indian Air
force in providing all necessary assistaice including helicopters for

rescue work as also for location of the crash site to this Court of
Inquiry.

200

My thanks also go to the staff of the West Bengal Legislative
Assembly as also the staff of the Manipur Government Circuit
House at Imphal for all their administrative assistance and courte-
sies extended to me and to the other members of this Court of
Inquiry.

I will be failing in my duty if I do not record my sincere
appreciation of the services rendered by Shri Lalit Gupta and Shri
R.K. Kohli in the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation,
without whose assistance tlus report could not have been prepared
within the target date. The untiring energy of these two young
genUcien needs special mention and praise.

While J thank all the lawyers who have assisted the Court in
its Inquiry, I record my special appreciation for the assistance
rendered by Capt. S.L. Bagchi, Capt. Mulherkar, Shri K.K. Saxena
aud Shri Dasgupta for their invaluable service to this Court of
Inquiry. I must also record iny very greal appreciation to Mr. Roy
Choudhury being the father of Late Capt. D.B. Roy Choudhury for
his assistance to this Court of Inquiry in the matter of identifica-
tion of voice. Mr. Roy Choudhury, prief-stricken as he was by
reason of the loss of his son, did come forward to assist the Court -
an indeed laudable gesture.

Finally my deepest condclences to the members of the be-
reaved faniilies both of crew and of the passengers.
